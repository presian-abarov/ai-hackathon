The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\n   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\n   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n   (for better or for worse).\\n\\n   I pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\n   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\n   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\n   a portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\n   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\n   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\n   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\n   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\n   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\n   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\n   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n   \"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\n   frames.\\n\\n   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\n   for the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\n   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\n   That\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\n   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\n   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\n   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\n   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\n   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\n   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\n   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\n   action, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\n   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\n   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\n   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n   \"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\n   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\n   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\n   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\n   ease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\n   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\n   switching.\\n\\n   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\n   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\n   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\n   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\n   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\n   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\n   even more...\\n\\n   Lawrence D\\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\n   Computer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\n   University of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\\n   Hamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\\' 26\" S, 175^ 19\\' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\\n\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that\\ncan significantly affect QuickTime\\'s playback speed that you may want to take\\ninto account:\\n\\n(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a\\nmovie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16\\nbit, but other depths are (of course) possible).\\n\\n(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for \"double size\" scaling, other scaling\\nfactors hit peformance much harder).\\n\\n(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices\\nto advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I\\'m not sure about Premiere).\\n\\nAny combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size\\nis, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also\\nmake a real difference.\\n\\nForgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...\\n\\n-Peter Lee\\n\\n ',\n",

December 1992 Author: Avi Raz\\n\\nSubject: Torture\\n\\nTitle of article: Moderate physical pressure\\n\\nSeveral times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation\\nroom in Tulkarm prison, during which he says he was humiliated,\\nbeaten and tortured, Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator, a\\nShabak agent \\'Captain Louis\\', chatting on the phone with his wife.\\n\"At those moments\", Omar said, \"I felt that he was like a\\nhumanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beat\\nme and say, \\'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed\\nyourself\\' and I understood that he was not really a human being\".\\n\\nIn late October 1992, after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm\\nprison, Omar Jaber was released without charges. \"Among the Jews,\\nas among the Arabs, there are good people and bad people\", he said\\nafter his release, \"but there, in Tulkarm, in the interrogations\\nrooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that\\nhe is a human being\". Although he left the detention installation\\nin Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (\"I sat at home for ten days. My\\nhands shook from nerves\"), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He\\ngot out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned\\nto normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns.\\n\\nIn contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was released\\nseven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the\\nShabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn\\'t speak or\\nreact. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early\\nAugust and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left\\nit one day later - dead. \"We have recently received an especially\\nlarge number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at\\nthe Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators\", noted\\nDr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and\\nPalestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...)\\n\\nThe right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan\\nSaber Makhlouf, a 20 year old student. In fact, he was extremely\\nfearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated\\nin Tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper would\\nreturn him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment.\\n\\n(...follow description of tortures....)\\n\\nOmar, a tall bearded man, was silent. \"I do not want to talk about\\nit\", he finally said, quietly. Some time later, embarrased and\\nashamed, he spoke: \"Sometimes he beats you and beats you until\\nyou\\'ll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. Even the hands of\\nanother interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room,\\nand the last interrogator says:\" Now you are kissing my hand, and\\nlater if I want, you will kiss my ass.\"\\n\\nThese things take place in an Israeli army detention installation,\\nlocated within the military government compound in Tulkarm (West\\nBank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In\\nearly March the IDF allowed representatives of B\\'Tselem, the\\nIsraeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, to\\nvisit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation\\nwing. \"The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solely\\nunder Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by\\nit\", said Lieutnant Sharon Sho\\'an, the commander of the\\ninstallation, according to the internal report written by B\\'tselem\\nmember, Yuval Ginbar, following the visit. Major David Pe\\'er,\\ngoverning commander of the prison system in the Central Command,\\nwas quoted in the report:  \"There is an ethical problem here - no\\none can enter the interrogation wing\".',\n",

Such a class would normally cost $40\\nor $50, so offering it free is a good promotion.\\n\\nOur Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished\\nteaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been\\nvery well received.  We get a lot of people who are novices\\ninterested in guns.  We even get a few who are anti-gun, but\\nfeel they should know something about \"gun safety\" since members\\nof their family keep guns at home.\\n\\nTeaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits:\\n\\n(1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases\\n    firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats.\\n\\n(2) A \"gun safety\" class is Politically Correct, and likely to\\n    be viewed positively by the public and the media.\\n\\n(3) Most of the students are \\'normal people\\' (not gun enthusiasts)\\n    and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a\\n    gentle introduction to firearms.\\n\\n(4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun\\n    and become more involved in shooting or personal defense.\\n\\n(5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners\\n    in general.  Our students see that we are all reasonable,\\n    non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate\\n    the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  Even anti-gun\\n    students sometimes tell us they have \"something new to think\\n    about\" with regards to personal gun ownership.\\n\\n(6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun.\\n\\nOur course is the standard NRA-certified \"Home Firearm Safety\"\\nclass, and our students pay only $5 for materials.  We also\\nteach the NRA\\'s \"Personal Protection\" class, although the cost\\nis higher for that one since we have to purchase range time.\\n\\nI think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to\\ngun buy-backs.',\n",

There should be no following of personalities in the church\\n(and in time, their writings)\\n   C.

So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing \\nby this \"hated\" book.  It\\'s okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me?\\nElisabeth, I\\'m going to quote from Zinsser\\'s Microbiology, 20th Edition.\\nA book that you should be familiar with and not \"hate\". \"Candida species \\ncolonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly \\nthereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.  \\nIndeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic \\nmycosis.\"  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic \\ninfection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or \\n\"sick\" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent \\nparasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.\\nYour assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute \\nit.\\n\\nWhat I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic \\ninfection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation\\n(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial \\ncompetition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida \\nblooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser\\'s again: \"However, some factors, such as \\nthe use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to \\nboth mucosal and systemic infections\".  I was addressing mucosal infections\\n(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers \\nthis effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the \"cure\".  I guess that \\nyour nutrition course does not, too bad.  \\n\\n\\n>>Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \\n>>called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\\n>>for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \\n>>yeast-like fungus.  \\n> \\n> Well, maybe I\\'m getting picky, but I always thought that a yeast\\n> was one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the\\n> mold form.  Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds, \\n> depending on environment.  Candida exibits what is known as\\n> reverse dimorphism - it exists as a mold in the tissues\\n> but exists as a yeast in the environment.  Should we maybe\\n> call it a mold infection?  a fungus infection?

(shudder)\\n> Or maybe you did know, and were oversimplifying?\\n\\nMy, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you \\nnoticed my faculty rank, I\\'m a biochemist, not a microbiologist.\\nCandida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser\\'s).  But, as you point \\nout, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells, \\npseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist \\nand that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it\\'s a lot of \\nGreek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me.\\n\\nYou know Elisabeth, I still haven\\'t been able to figure out why such a small \\nlittle organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in \\nSci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too.\\nI keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what \\nI\\'ve said, that it will make sense.  I\\'m not asking anyone here to buy into \\n\"The Yeast Connection\" book because I don\\'t know what\\'s in that book, plain \\nand simple.

Ipser, Jr., 1993\\n>\\n\\nHere\\'s my own top ten response to Mr. Ipser\\'s list\\n\\n\\n10.  It\\'s about time we have a President that might actually stand up to the\\n     military.  Our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not\\n     revolve around them, and that one of the things they\\'re out there defending\\n     is our right to be critical of them, even denounce them.\\n\\n9.   Let me explain something to you.  Environmental policy and industrial\\n     policy MUST go hand in hand.  Our nation, and indeed, our planet cannot\\n     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years.\\n     Our industrial/environmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL! We\\n     must have active government support of the key industries such as,\\n     telecommunications, microelectronics, medical, biotech, and environmental\\n     tech.  Meanwhile weed out old, inneficient, high-polution, industries\\n     that are better left to other nations.  This will make us richer, help\\n     produce new jobs, and help the environment.  To give credit where credit\\n     is due, I heard a lot of this in a speech by Senator John Kerry (D-MA)\\n     tonite.  In addition, it\\'s time we get really, really serious about \\n     issues like overpopulation, globabl warming, and ozone depletion.  The\\n     planet on which we live should be our utmost priority!\\n\\n8.   It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work,\\n     to provide the services that people need, and to help solve the problems\\n     that need to be solved.  Granted, some things can probably be done more\\n     efficiently for less money, and should be.  But some things are going to\\n     cost more money and I\\'m sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about\\n     taxes all the time.  You want to live in my country, you pay your fair\\n     share!\\n\\n7.   I can\\'t believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give\\n     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes.  If you\\'re\\n     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an\\n     enemy which at best doesn\\'t affect us and at worst really should be our\\n     friend, then you have no right to tell me you shouldn\\'t pay taxes!\\n\\n6.   Hey, I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60\\'s-esque touch!\\n\\n5.   Look, Canada, Europe, and Japan manage to provide health care for their\\n     citizens (and, yes, basic health IS a human right which people are\\n     entitled to).  If these nations aren\\'t capitalist enough for you, then\\n     I guess we\\'ve found something better than capitalism!  There is nothing\\n     sacred about the capitalist system, and if something, be it socialism\\n     or anything else, works better, then I say let capitalism die.\\n\\n4.   Make love, not War!\\n\\n3.   Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to be a male and a feminist\\n     at the same time.  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity\\n     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong, and trying to force\\n     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse.  Women certainly \\n     have as much to offer this world as men, and the day that gender\\n     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of\\n     the past few centuries seem like reform bills.

       " '----- Begin Included Message -----\\n\\nThe following teaching is brought to you on behalf of Malcolm Smith\\nMinistries, a ministry dedicated to leading believers everywhere into a\\nknowledge of the love of God.  If you would like more info on the ministry,\\nand/or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial,\\ne-mail to Randy Hunt at rlhunt@hou.amoco.com.\\n\\n\\nLOVE IN THE MORNING  (Psalm 90:14)\\n\\nby Malcolm Smith\\n\\nMoses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of Israel. A generation\\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\\nthan God\\'s way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\\nat Kadesh and had God\\' s promise of one day entering the land. The\\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt\\'s gods as He led\\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What\\' s next on the miracle menu?\"\\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men\\'s lives had hung\\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God\\'s glorious\\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God\\'s love is not an emotion\\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\\nmother\\'s love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love\\'s excitement, a love\\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents\\' love is\\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents\\' love. It is a\\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God\\'s love will the rest of life\\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won\\'t\\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses\\' prayer was partially\\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man\\' s highest\\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\\n',\n",

Does\\nthis mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder\\nbecause he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent\\nsupporter?\\n\\nOne of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system\\nwas far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party\\nitself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was\\nnoone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not\\noriginaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it\\nuntil his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged\\nupon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of \\nhis supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the\\nold guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications\\nof their rhetoric. \\n\\nThis is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must\\nbe considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one \"race\"\\nof people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of\\nhumanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,\\nthe gas chambers of Auschwitz.\\n\\nThe NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who\\nlead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the\\nevil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.\\nHitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego\\ncult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however\\nmean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and\\nhis propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can\\nproduce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be \\nemphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between\\na govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to \\ngovern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the\\nlatter as a \"strong\" government since most displays of strength are made\\nnecessary by an essential weakness.\\n\\nIt is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they\\namoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the\\nsame manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause\\nof morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their\\nlogic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties\\nsuch as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert\\nthe truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates\\nof a system that would commit genocide. \\n\\nThe conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is\\ninescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let\\nthe conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that\\nwere basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of\\nthe concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly\\ndoes not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.\\n\\nNo matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon \\nelection those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.\\nIf this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made\\nthe pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates\\na dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many\\nin government politics is a method of providing a justification for\\ntheir own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A \\nrhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the\\ncontinued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the\\nessential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli\\nwhich has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important\\nto realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right\\nand those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement\\nof popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.\\nIn the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through\\ntheir assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.\\n\\nIt is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics\\nof political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The\\nleaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do\\nso voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a \\ntask without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of\\nones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore\\nin taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole\\nbefore personal concerns, even of personal security.\\n\\nAlthough it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred\\nand an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit\\ngenocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded.

Rushdie was writing\\nabout a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing\\nthe actor \"Gibreel\" in the role of the angel whose name he took.\\nRushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims\\nor implies that this is what actually happened.  It\\'s somewhat like\\nstories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed\\nprostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to the\\nArthurian mythos, or the Grail legend, or the Wandering Jew, or dozens\\nof others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer,\\nconsider Salman Rushdie\\'s children\\'s book \"Haroun and the Sea of\\nStories\" for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific\\nstoryteller -- works with existing story lines.\\n\\n>to ridicule Muhammad\\'s integrity...\\n\\nNo.  Muhammad\\'s [Mahound\\'s] integrity is not really impugned in this\\npart of the story, and there\\'s no reason to think this was Rushdie\\'s\\nintent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine and\\nsatanic), though he doesn\\'t know their provenance.  It is not implied\\n(in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:\\n\\n    \" *Not my voice* I\\'d never know such words I\\'m no classy speaker\\n    never was never will be but this isn\\'t my voice it\\'s a Voice.\\n      Mahound\\'s eyes open wide, he\\'s seeing some kind of vision,\\n    staring at it, oh, that\\'s right, Gibreel remembers, me.  He\\'s\\n    seeing me.  My lips moving, being moved by.  What, whom?  Don\\'t\\n    know, can\\'t say.

Is it Satan?\\nOr something else?  The answer is not given.\\n\\nTo be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the\\nrole of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing loss\\nof faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation,\\nbut this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.

Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\\n\\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\nNeXT:\\n\\nImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format\\nconversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.\\nImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at\\nsonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are\\ncurrently being re-organized, so it\\'s hard to point to specific\\nsub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that\\ndoes not support JPEG.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n',\n",

       " \"Yes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are \\nfinally moving in the right direction.  They should finish\\nover .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race \\nin August.  However, I would take back a few moves:\\n\\n1.  The Jim Abbott Trade.\\n    I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a\\n    great pitcher also.  He could win the Cy Young this year, \\n    but he won't because the right side of the Yanks infield\\n    isn't good enough.  So why was this not a good trade?  \\n    JT Snow.  How many rookies have been able to step in and\\n    immediately have the impact that he has had so far on \\n    the Angels?  I know it's early, but if you've seen this kid\\n    hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be \\n    a tremendous player.  The Yanks should have kept him.  What\\n    about Mattingly, you ask?  Well - it's great that the Yanks\\n    have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he's 10 years\\n    older than Snow and just doesn't have the same bat speed as\\n    before his back injury.  It's a shame, but as a Yankee fan \\n    who wants to see the *best* Yankee team, I'd take \\n    Snow over Mattingly at first.  The Yanks also gave up two\\n    promising propects with Snow for Abbott.  Besides, with\\n    Domingo Jean, Brien taylor, Wickman, Militello, and Sterling\\n    Hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects.  I know Abbotts\\n    only 26, but this was too much to give up.  I believe George\\n    forced this trade because he believes (and he's right) that\\n    Abbott will be a big hit in NY.  However, I'd like to see the\\n    Yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show.\\n\\n2.  Wade Boggs.\\n    I live in Boston and like Wade a lot.  But, his career is \\n    winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop\\n    a long term solution (i.e. Hensley Muelins, Russ Davis, Velarde?).\\n    Besides, Wade just doesn't have any range.  What a shame about\\n    Charlie Hayes, huh?\\n\\n3.  Spike Owen.\\n    See Wade Boggs.  I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri\\n    or whoever.  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is\\n    going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point.  And these guys\\n    are on the down sides of their careers.\\n\\n4.  Danny Tartabull.\\n    Yes - he's put up some tremendous numbers and it's nice to think\\n    about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year.  But he\\n    never is.  We should expect 120 games max out of him.  Meanwhile,\\n    Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O'Neil is playing\\n    left field!  I believe O'Neil led NL outfielders in assists\\n    last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder.\\n\\nWhat I'm basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right\\ndirection but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year.  They should\\n(at the GM level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series.  This\\nmeans getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they \\nwill be ready in a year or two.  \\n\\nI'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner.\\nCertainly, the Boggs deal was all George.  It looks like George is\\nplanning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world\\nseries now.  The veterans are always available and can be added at any\\ntime (like Boston did this year).  Develop the young players first,\\nthen add the one or two veterans (or in the Yankees case, just keep\\nthem).  Let's all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn't dismantle\\nthe terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee\\norganization back into one of respect.  I'm really afraid that he will\\ntrade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for\\nexample).  George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is\\nstill one or two years away.  Have patience George and we will all\\nenjoy the future.

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their\\n   highest court \"Supreme Court,\" \"Supreme Judicial Court\" or \"Supreme\\n   Court of Appeals,\" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the\\n   \"Court of Appeals.\"  To make matters worse, New York also calls its\\n   _second-highest_ court the \"Supreme Court, Appellate Division\"...\\n\\nAtlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):\\n\\nOscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company\\'s\\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\\nwhich came first, the plaintiff\\'s acquisition of the land or he\\ndefendant\\'s start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\\nplaintiffs\\' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\\n\\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\\nAtlantic Cement\\'s actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\\n\\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs\\' request for an injunction, the court\\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\\nalways problematical even when it\\'s done by the state; allowing a\\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\\n\\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn\\'t call it eminent domain.  But if\\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\\nlike eminent domain...)\\n\\nLet me take issue with the way you\\'ve presented the case... you say that\\n\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn\\'t allow the\\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?\\n\\n    (Pulls out Black\\'s Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\\n    \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\\n    extortion statutes.\")\\n\\nHow do you define as \"blackmail\" one party\\'s act of demanding the right\\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\\nthey wanted.  There isn\\'t, or at least shouldn\\'t be, any law that says\\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\\n\\nYou go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- the\\nplaintiff\\'s lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"\\n\\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn\\'t want to have to face a choice\\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\\nshouldn\\'t Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\\nAtlantic Cement\\'s own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\\n\\nAnd then you say: \"Everyone\\'s property rights were protected; the\\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\"\\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\"\\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\nbusiness of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\\n(If so, I\\'ve been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\\n\\n> Is _Boomer_ really being taught as \"infamous?\"  That\\'s really sad if\\n> it is, because I fail to see how it\\'s less than completely sensible.\\n> You should read the law and economics stuff first-hand instead of\\n> filtered through teachers who clearly don\\'t like it, for whatever\\n> inexplicable reasons.\\n\\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my\\nschool.\\n\\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.

This is\\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\\n\\nI called it infamous because that\\'s my opinion of it.

The hint is in the proposal that this or\\nsimilar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions\\nsuch as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how\\nthis thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat\\nthis in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other\\nareas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if\\nthis proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in\\nseveral other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not\\ngoing to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop\\nwhenever they want to.  \\'Court order required\\' has proven to be a rather\\nflimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the\\nmaterial, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on\\nperiodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice\\nsystem the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty\\n(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not\\nprotected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would\\nresult in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions\\non private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it\\ndoes make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially\\nfishing expeditions without the target\\'s knowlege.  Don\\'t give up the\\nright to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton\\nand Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,\\nfiguring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come\\nthose consulted could be roughly described as \"us insiders\"?  They cannot\\nquietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its\\nexclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.\\nDon\\'t buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,\\npast or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest\\nand the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not \\'unlikely\\'\\nor \\'difficult\\'.\\n\\n>But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the\\n>judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext\\n>without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can\\'t record today\\'s plain\\n>cellular calls and then ask a judge, \"Hey, can we have permission to\\n>listen to those tapes?\" can they?\\n\\nSo what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved\\nafter the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,\\neasily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,\\nwould authorize a tap which wouldn\\'t have been possible otherwise.  This\\nhas been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For\\nlocal cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds\\nhave a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe\\nfor example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen\\nin on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or\\nvia a \\'master key\\'?  I sure don\\'t.\\n\\nThis whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use\\nold-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping\\nwas rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law\\nEnforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes\\nthat require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I\\njust find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much\\nabout civil and individual rights, that \"puts people first\".  The question\\nis \"put people first\" to WHERE?\\n\\nWith the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN\\'T\\nexist a \\'master key\\' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword\\nscan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific\\ncourt order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.\\nBet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that\\nthey have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to\\nkeep them from simply keeping the keys on file for \\'next time\\'? After\\nawhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks\\nthey deem \\'disruptive\\'.  And if they get only one key, that would\\nreduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember\\nNixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn\\'t it?\\n\\nAnd unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!\\nI see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice\\n:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to\\na competitor\\'s Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded\\nto be used for all non-government encryption).

However the\\n>meaning of that is complex, since they still want to get at the crypttext\\n>on telco systems, and that requires a bit of work.\\n\\nPeople would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years,\\nbecause we have this \\'crisis\\' situation which MUST be addressed by some\\n\\'drastic action\\', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother\\nthose who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don\\'t buy into it.\\n\\nIf the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public\\nso many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few\\nisolated \\'respected experts\\' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a\\ncertain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected\\nexperts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was\\nadvocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the\\nexperts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper\\nChip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled\\nversion (with a \\'master key\\' provision), or features not present in the\\nversion subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who\\nchooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there...\\n:-)\\n\\nAnd isn\\'t it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT\\nhave its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?\\nI was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything\\nyou have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this\\ngroup are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...\\n\\nAnother question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not\\nbe used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure\\nbut \"good enough\" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full\\ndescription (not a PR non-statement) of just what \"good enough\" means?\\nI think when saying how strong it is, \"good enough\" really means \"not\\nvery\".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not\\nacceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and\\nConstitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other\\ncountries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as\\nrevokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and\\nprotections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA\\nhave this thing to \\'fight crime\\'.  We have allready have our Bill of\\nRights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining\\nfor yet another \\'noble cause\\', instead we should be trying to repair\\nthe damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \"too\\nmany rights and safeguards\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court\\nsystem and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having\\n\"too many rights\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,\\netc).\\n\\nBTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe\\nthis:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed\\nthis thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights\\nunder the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades\\nhave been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the\\nConstitution.  It has to stop.  Now is as good a time as any, if it\\nisn\\'t too late allready.\\n\\n>-- \\n>Brad Templeton, ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale, CA 408/296-0366\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'Here is a press release from the White House.\\n\\n Text of President Clinton\\'s Letter to Congress on Iranian Assets\\n To: National Desk\\n Contact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2100\\n\\n   WASHINGTON, May 14  -- Following is a letter\\nPresident Clinton wrote to Congress on Iranian Assets:\\n\\n  TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:\\n\\n       I hereby report to the Congress on developments since the\\n  last Presidential report on November 10, 1992, concerning the\\n  national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in\\n  Executive Order No. 12170 of November 14, 1979, and matters\\n  relating to Executive Order No. 12613 of October 29, 1987.\\n  This report is submitted pursuant to section 204(c) of the\\n  International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c),\\n  and section 505(c) of the International Security and Development\\n  Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9(c).  This report\\n  covers events through March 31, 1993.  The last report, dated\\n  November 10, 1992, covered events through October 15, 1992.\\n\\n       1.  There have been no amendments to the Iranian\\n  Transactions Regulations (\"ITRs\"), 31 CFR Part 560, or to the\\n  Iranian Assets Control Regulations (\"IACRs\"), 31 CFR Part 535,\\n  since the last report.\\n\\n       2.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"FAC\") of the\\n  Department of the Treasury continues to process applications\\n  for import licenses under the ITRs.  However, as previously\\n  reported, recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a\\n  substantial decrease in the number of applications received\\n  relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranian-origin goods.\\n\\n       During the reporting period, the Customs Service has\\n  continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin\\n  merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import\\n  prohibitions of the ITRs.  FAC and Customs Service investi-\\n  gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions\\n  and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.  Additional\\n  forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review.\\n\\n       3.  The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the\\n  \"Tribunal\"), established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers\\n  Accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims\\n  before it.  Since the last report, the Tribunal has rendered\\n  12 awards, for a total of 545 awards.  Of that total, 367 have\\n  been awards in favor of American claimants:  222 of these were\\n  awards on agreed terms, authorizing and approving payment of\\n  settlements negotiated by the parties, and 145 were decisions\\n  adjudicated on the merits.  The Tribunal has issued 36 decisions\\n  dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing\\n  claims for jurisdictional reasons.  Of the 59 remaining awards,\\n  3 approved the withdrawal of cases, and 56 were in favor of\\n  Iranian claimants.  As of March 31, 1993, awards to successful\\n  American claimants from the Security Account held by the\\n  NV Settlement Bank stood at $2,340,072,357.77.\\n\\n       As of March 31, 1993, the Security Account has fallen\\n  below the required balance of $500 million 36 times.  Iran has\\n  periodically replenished the account, as required by the Algiers\\n  Accords, by transferring funds from the separate account held by\\n  the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account\\n  is deposited.  Iran has also replenished the account with the\\n  proceeds from the sale of Iranian-origin oil imported into the\\n  United States, pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by-\\n  case basis by FAC.  Iran has not, however, replenished the\\n  account since the last oil sale deposit on October 8, 1992.\\n  The aggregate amount that has been transferred from the Interest\\n  Account to the Security Account is $874,472,986.47.  As of\\n  March 31, 1993, the total amount in the Security Account was\\n  $216,244,986.03, and the total amount in the Interest Account\\n  was $8,638,133.15.\\n\\n       4.  The Tribunal continues to make progress in the\\n  arbitration of claims of U.S. nationals for $250,000.00 or more.\\n  Since the last report, nine large claims have been decided.\\n  More than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been\\n  disposed of through adjudication, settlement, or voluntary\\n  withdrawal, leaving 76 such claims on the docket.  The larger\\n  claims, the resolution of which has been slowed by their\\n  complexity, are finally being resolved, sometimes with sizable\\n  awards to the U.S. claimants.  For example, two claimants were\\n  awarded more than $130 million each by the Tribunal in October\\n  1992.\\n\\n       5.  As anticipated by the May 13, 1990, agreement settling\\n  the claims of U.S. nationals for less than $250,000.00, the\\n  Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (\"FCSC\") has continued its\\n  review of 3,112 claims.  The FCSC has issued decisions in\\n  1,201 claims, for total awards of more than $22 million.  The\\n  FCSC expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining\\n  claims in early 1994.\\n\\n       6.  In coordination with concerned Government agencies,\\n  the Department of State continues to present United States\\n  Government claims against Iran, as well as responses by the\\n  United States Government to claims brought against it by Iran.\\n  In November 1992, the United States filed 25 volumes of\\n  supporting information in case B/1 (Claims 2 & 3), Iran\\'s claim\\n  against the United States for damages relating to its Foreign\\n  Military Sales Program.  In February of this year, the United\\n  States participated in a daylong prehearing conference in\\n several other cases involving military equipment.  Iran also\\n  filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure\\n  of U.S. courts to enforce an award against a U.S. corporation\\n  violated the Algiers Accords.\\n\\n       7.  As reported in November, Jose Maria Ruda, President of\\n  the Tribunal, tendered his resignation on October 2, 1992.  No\\n  successor has yet been named.  Judge Ruda\\'s resignation will\\n  take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up\\n  his duties.\\n\\n       8.  The situation reviewed above continues to involve\\n  important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the\\n  United States and its nationals.  Iran\\'s policy behavior\\n  presents challenges to the national security and foreign\\n  policy of the United States.  The IACRs issued pursuant to\\n  Executive Order No. 12170 continue to play an important role\\n  in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling\\n  the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords.\\n  Similarly, the ITRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12613\\n  continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter-\\n  national terrorism.  I shall exercise the powers at my disposal\\n  to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the\\n  Congress on significant developments.\\n\\n\\n                         WILLIAM J.

Olson was still\\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\\n\\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\\nand Berryhill couldn\\'t hit their way out of a wet cardboard\\nbox, and don\\'t walk enough to be useful.\\n\\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\\nat the start of the season, he wouldn\\'t have gotten his job back.\\n\\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\\nPlus, you\\'d have to eat that salary, which isn\\'t huge, but isn\\'t\\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson\\'s at about $800,000, Berryhill\\nat $450,000, but that\\'s only what I recall).\\n\\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players\\naren\\'t eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster\\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the\\nfirst time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.\\n\\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn\\'t on the team.\\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\\nand the truth is that I\\'d rather see our best team on the field,\\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\\n\\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won\\'t need him. ;)\\n\\nAs for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\\nlike this:  (Remember, they\\'ve BOTH been GM\\'s)\\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\\n\\nCox:  OK, we\\'ve sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\\nis better than it used to be.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\\njust won\\'t sign that baseball only contract.  We can\\'t count\\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman\\'s not ready to give up on\\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher\\'s gone AND Deion signs,\\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\\n\\nCox:  Yep, that\\'ll be nice.  Too bad Deion won\\'t sign.\\nOK, I\\'ll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\\nKlesko?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ve still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\\nbut somehow he doesn\\'t seem to be the same GM.  First\\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I\\'d HAVE to believe that he\\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\\n\\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I\\'ll wait til the trading\\ndeadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\\nAnd if that doesn\\'t work, then perhaps Sid\\'s knees\\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There\\'s always the\\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\\n\\nCox:  Well, he\\'s not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\\nin Richmond, he\\'ll start walking more.  Besides, if he\\'s going to be\\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Now, let\\'s see.  That leaves Lopez.\\n\\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn\\'t think Olson\\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\\nrunning into him again?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he\\'ll get\\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson\\'s shown his stuff a little\\nbit, I can\\'t trade him.  Besides, Berryhill\\'s a left-handed\\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\\n\\nCox:  Don\\'t you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you\\'re the one who wouldn\\'t write Lopez\\ninto the lineup.\\n\\nCox:  Well, you\\'re the one who went out and got me Jeff\\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn\\'t be used\\nto our pitching staff\\'s stuff.  He got some time with\\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\\nwill be hurt by May.\\n\\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\\nTHE WORLD SERIES!  I\\'ll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey\\nStengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto,\\nbut have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I\\'ll finally\\nget my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those\\n\"happy pills\" left around by Chuck Tanner?  Why\\'d you\\never hire that guy anyhow?\\n\\nCox:  Don\\'t ask me; ask Ted.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nEric Roush\\t\\tfierkelab@\\tbchm.biochem.duke.edu\\n\"I am a Marxist, of the Groucho sort\"\\nGrafitti, Paris, 1968\\n\\nTANSTAAFL!

Do not\\n\\t  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I\\'ve had people try to dismount\\n\\t  in traffic, just as I\\'m pulling in to a parking space!)\\n\\t- Muffler gets HOT! (\\'Nuff said)\\n\\t- We get *GOOD* traction.  We\\'re not going to fall over.  (Many\\n\\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\\n\\t- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you\\'re sitting upright and\\n\\t  we\\'re going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you\\'re\\n\\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\\n\\t  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \\n\\t- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \\n\\t  gradual, so I can compensate.\\n\\t- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\\n\\t- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \\n\\t  thing -- I\\'ve driven many miles on this thing, and know how\\n\\t  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\\n\\t  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \\n\\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \\n\\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she\\'d holler, \"SLOW DOWN!

As a counterexample to \\nwhat you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:\\n\\n               Non-Clutch                      Clutch\\n               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA\\n \\nMaldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307\\nLemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223\\n\\nIf you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those \"clutch\"\\nsituations, you\\'d bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in \\n1988, Maldonado hit .267 in \"non-clutch\" and .190 in \"clutch\", while Lemon\\nhit .254 in \"non-clutch\" and .313 in \"clutch\".  Before you accuse me of \\ncompletely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ \"clutch\"\\nat bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias).  As a simple\\nmeasure of clutchness, let\\'s just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use \\n\\'84-\\'87 to predict \\'88 for those 96 players, you\\'d find that 27 of the\\n96 were below league average in that measure both in \\'84-87 and in \\'88,\\n26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were \\nabove in one and below in the other.  If you were just flipping coins,\\nyou\\'d expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched.  The\\ndifference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment\\nis not statisically significant.\\n\\nBTW, correlating players\\' _overall_ batting average from \\'84-\\'87 with\\n\\'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at\\nsomething better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their\\n(clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of \\n0.088, significant at no level of any interest.\\n\\n>\\n>\\n>>       Everyone would agree (I hope) that a grand \\n>>\\tslam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three\\n>>\\tis a VERY clutch hit.

I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere\\n> evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet.  The question\\n> is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions.\\n\\nThis is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding\\nof what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth\\'s\\natmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive\\nanswer is \"photosynthesis\", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis\\nby itself can\\'t make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced\\nis consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed\\nis photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of\\nthe resulting reduced material.\\n\\nOn earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic\\nmatter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires\\ncontinental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow\\nthat most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).\\n\\nThis suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without\\ncontinents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating\\nan oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a\\nhard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.\\n\\nThere is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth\\'s atmosphere\\nhas been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least\\n2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to\\nweathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback\\nmechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak\\nanthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen\\nlevel had dropped too low, we wouldn\\'t be here to be wondering about\\nit.',\n",

       " \"Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's \\n\\tContest Announcement)\\n\\nWHAT IS ACCESS.bus?\\n\\nACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer \\nperipheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that \\nuses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to \\na single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or \\nkeypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR \\ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \\nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications \\nsuch as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, \\nMultiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more \\ncan now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts \\nPlug and Play on every PC.\\n\\nThe ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \\nsystems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host \\ncomputer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a \\nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \\ndevelopment.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-\\nplatform use of the same device.\\n\\nACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:\\n=====================================\\n\\nACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \\nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \\nfee or royalty.\\nACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single \\nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus \\ndata rate is 100 Kbits/sec.\\n\\nACCESS.bus Physical Layer\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware \\nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\\nStandard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level \\nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \\nsynchronization.  \\n\\nACCESS.bus Software Protocols\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three \\nlevels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.\\n\\nI2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines \\narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C \\nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \\ndifferent clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, \\nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \\nreceiver.  \\n\\nBASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \\na host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the \\nACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an \\nACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with \\nadditional semantics, including checksum.\\nUnique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot \\nplugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \\naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot \\nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \\nsystem is running, without rebooting.\\n\\nAPPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus \\nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \\ntypes of devices.  Each type requires a different Application \\nProtocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: \\nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\\n\\nACCESS.bus support on the PC\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nAll three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the \\nPC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \\nbase protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  \\nAn ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 \\n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \\nthe ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for \\nmultiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and \\nWindows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples \\nof the interface from applications to the device drivers.\\n\\n\\nTo Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):\",\n",

For\\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\\n\\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\\nfrom past masters.\\n\\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\\n\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\" \\nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\\'ve made us mad!  What are these\\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\\n\\n     Well I\\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\\n\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\\nless than many billions of dollars.\\n\\n     It took some of the last generation\\'s experts to teach us\\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\\'s first rocket was not a\\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\\'s ICBM\\'s didn\\'t take ten years to\\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\\'t cost $1 billion.\\n\\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\\'s to remind\\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\\'s. \\nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\\nlittle, Test a little.\\n\\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\\ndidn\\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\\'d just change\\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\\nknown as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn\\'t spend a\\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\\'s the\\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\\'t\\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\\nthreat that he\\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\\nit ran over cost or schedule.\\n\\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\\'t keep in mind its\\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\\nbudget.\\n\\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\\n(See charts)\\n\\n     I\\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\\'s\\nand 1960\\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\\ncan\\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\\n\\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\\n\\n     I say to you -- we\\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\\nbring your view-graphs, and I\\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.

I want to find out--from here, from there, from \\nthe government--why my husband was killed.\\n\\nOn the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home.\\nHe doesn\\'t work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, \"Mamma, is \\nthere a soccer game?\" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That\\'s where we \\nlived. I say, \"I don\\'t know, Igor, I haven\\'t turned on the TV.\" He looked \\nagain and said, \"Mamma, what\\'s going on in the courtyard?!\" I look and see so \\nmany people, it\\'s awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands, \\nyou can\\'t even tell how many there are. They\\'re shouting, \"Down with the \\nArmenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" My God, why is \\nthat happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together\\nwell, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely \\nunexpected. And they were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" And they had flags,\\nand they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he\\'s \\naround 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I \\ncan\\'t make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something,\\nand the children behind him are shouting, \"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" and \\n\"Down with the Armenians!\" They shout it again, and then shout, \"Hurrah!\" The \\npeople streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I \\nsaw that there were women, too. I say, \"My God, there are women there too!\" \\nAnd my son says, \"Those aren\\'t women, Mamma, those are bad women.\" Well we \\ndidn\\'t look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I \\nsimply couldn\\'t sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani \\nneighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \"Khalida, what\\'s going on, what \\nhappened?\" She says, \"Emma, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know what \\nhappened.\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks, \\neach second or third one had a white rod. They\\'re waving the rods above their \\nheads as they walk, and the one who\\'s out front, like a leader, he has a white\\nstick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I \\ndon\\'t know.\\n\\nMy husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \"Oh \\ndear, I\\'m frightened, they\\'re going to kill us I bet.\" And he says, \"What are \\nyou afraid of, they\\'re just children.\" I say, \"Everything that happens comes \\nfrom children.\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and \\nVocational School. \"Don\\'t fear,\" he said, \"it\\'s nothing, nothing all that \\nbad.\" He didn\\'t eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they\\nbroadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. \\nWhen I heard that I couldn\\'t settle down at all, I kept walking here and \\nthere and I said, \"They\\'re going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to \\nkill us.\" And he says, \"Don\\'t be afraid.\" Then we heard--from the central \\nsquare, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they\\'re shouting\\ndifferent things, and you couldn\\'t hear every well. I say, \"You speak\\nAzerbaijani well, listen to what they\\'re saying.\" He says \"Close the window\\nand go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\" He listened a bit and then \\nclosed the window and went to bed, and told us, \"Come on, go to sleep, it\\'s\\nnothing.\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window\\nuntil two in the morning watching. Well he\\'s sick, and all of this was\\naffecting him. I say, \"Igor, you go to bed, I\\'m going to go to bed in a minute\\ntoo.\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. \\nThings had calmed down slightly.\\n\\nThe 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \"Come on, Emma, \\nget up.\" I say, \"Today\\'s my day off, let me rest.\" He says, \"Aren\\'t you going \\nto make me some tea?\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \"Where are \\nyou going?\" He says, \"I\\'m going out, I have to.\" I say, \"Can you really go \\noutside on a day like today? Don\\'t go out, for God\\'s sake. You never listen to\\nme, I know, and you\\'re not going to listen to me now, but at least don\\'t take \\nthe car out of the garage, go without the car.\" And he says, \"Come on, close \\nthe door!\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn\\'t make it\\nout, he probably said \"coward\" or something.\\n\\nI closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up\\naround the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o\\'clock in the after-\\nnoon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,\\n\"Khalida, was it our car?\" She says, \"No, no, Emma, don\\'t be afraid, they\\nwere government cars and Zhigulis.\\'\\' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,\\nit was four o\\'clock, five o\\'clock . . . and when he wasn\\'t home at seven I\\nsaid, \"Oh, they\\'ve killed Shagen!\"\\n\\nTires are burning in town, there\\'s black smoke in town, and I\\'m afraid, I\\'m \\nstanding on the balcony and I\\'m all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, \\nthey\\'ve probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten \\no\\'clock and he still hadn\\'t come home. And I\\'m afraid to go out. At ten\\no\\'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,\\nand from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. \\nI\\'m looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I \\ndon\\'t want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn\\'t want me to see \\nit. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \"Mamma,\" he says,\\n\"look what they\\'re doing over there!\" They were burning everything, and there \\nwere police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing \\non the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are \\nthrowing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony \\nis shouting, \"What are you standing there for, burn it!\" When they threw the \\ntelevision, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out \\non her balcony and shouted, \"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those\\nthings, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their \\nhome. Why are you burning them?\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \"Go \\ninside, go inside! Instead why don\\'t you tell us if they are any of them in \\nyour building or not?\" They meant Armenians, but they didn\\'t say Armenians, \\nthey said, \"of them.\" She says, \"No, no, no, none!\" Then she ran downstairs to\\nour place, and says, \"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\" I say, \"They\\'ve killed\\nShagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won\\'t be living for me without \\nShagen. Let them kill us, too!\" She insists, saying, \"Emma, get out of here, \\ngo to Khalida\\'s, and give me the key. When they come I\\'ll say that it\\'s my \\ndaughter\\'s apartment, that they\\'re off visiting someone.\" I gave her the key \\nand went to the neighbor\\'s, but I couldn\\'t endure it. I say, \"Igor, you stay \\nhere, I\\'m going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa\\'s . . . Papa\\'s there.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and \\nValery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in \\nthe courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they\\'re shouting, howling, \\nand I didn\\'t think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived\\nin the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw\\nan Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \"Madar, \\nUncle Shagen\\'s gone, let\\'s go see, maybe he\\'s dead in the garage or near the \\ngarage, let\\'s at least bring the corpse into the house. \"He shouts, \"Aunt \\nEmma, where do you think you\\'re going?! Go back into the house, I\\'ll look for \\nhim.\" I say, \"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, \\nI\\'m coming too.\" Well he wouldn\\'t let me go all the same, he says, \"You stay \\nhere with us, I\\'m go look.\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \"Aunt \\nEmma, there\\'s no one there, the garage is closed. \"Madar went off again and \\nthen returned and said, \"Aunt Emma, they\\'re already killed Alik, and Valery\\'s \\nthere . . . wheezing.\"\\n\\nMadar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \"Don\\'t go near him, \\nor we\\'ll put you next to him.\" He got scared--he\\'s young--and came back and \\nsaid, \"I\\'m going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take \\nAlik, maybe he\\'ll live . . . \" They grew up together in our courtyard, they \\nknew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but\\nnot a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and \\ncalled, and called, and called--nothing.\\n\\nI went upstairs to the neighbor\\'s. Igor says, \"Two police cars drove up over \\nthere, their headlights are on, but they\\'re not touching them, they are still \\nlying where they were, they\\'re still lying there . . . \"We watched out the\\nwindow until four o\\'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn\\'t\\ntake my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six\\no\\'clock in the morning I got up and said, \"Igor, you stay here at home, don\\'t\\ngo out, don\\'t go anywhere, I\\'m going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or\\nalive . . . let me go . . . I\\'ve got the keys from work.\"\\n\\nAt six o\\'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another \\ndoctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \"Doctor, is \\nShagen there?\" He says, \"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\" I \\nwanted to go in, but he wouldn\\'t let me. There were only four people in there,\\nthey said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn\\'t let me in. They\\nsaid, \"Shagen\\'s not here, he\\'s alive somewhere, he\\'ll come back.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s already seven o\\'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck\\nwith three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with\\nthem. I say, \"Sara Baji [\"Sister\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they\\'ve\\nprobably brought Shagen.\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back\\nand says, \"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it\\'s a younger person.\" Now Shagen \\njust happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they \\nsaid it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \"Doctor, they\\'ve \\nbrought Shagen in dead.\" He says, \"Why are you carrying on like that, dead, \\ndead . . . he\\'s alive.\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back \\nthe look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They\\nknew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \"Doctor, \\nis it Shagen?\" He says, \"No, Emma, it\\'s not he, it\\'s somebody else entirely.\" \\nI say, \"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I\\'ll find out all the same anyway, \\nif not today, then tomorrow.\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the\\noffice. He says, \"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\" Another one of our \\ncolleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous \\ncondition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn\\'t Shagen. A few minutes \\nlater another colleague comes in and says, \"Oh, poor Emma!\" When she said it \\nlike that there was no hope left.\\n\\n   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured \\npeople.\\n\\nAt night someone took me home. I said, \"Igor, Papa\\'s been killed.\"\\n\\nOn the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: \\nI had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is \\nsurrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \"Hey, citizen, where \\nare you going?\" I say, \"I work here,\" and from inside someone shouts, \"Yes, \\nyes, that\\'s our cook, let her in.\" I went right to the head doctor\\'s office\\nand there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to\\nwork with us at the hospital. He says, \"Emma, Shagen\\'s been taken to Baku.\\nIn the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\" I\\nsay, \"Doctor, how will I bury him?\" He says, \"We\\'re taking care of all that,\\ndon\\'t you worry, we\\'ll do everything, we\\'ll tell you about it. Where did you\\nspend the night?\" I say, \"I was at home.\" He says, \"What do you mean you\\nwere at home?! You were at home alone?\" I say, \"No, Igor was there too.\" He\\nsays, \"You can\\'t stay home, we\\'re getting an ambulance right now, wait just\\none second, the head doctor is coming, we\\'re arranging an ambulance right\\nnow, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here\\nlike a patient, and you\\'ll stay here and we\\'ll se~ later what to do next ...\"\\nHis last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor\\'s name is Izyat Jamalogli\\nSadukhov.\\n\\nThe \"ambulance\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a \\npatient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the \\nhospital until the 4th.\\n\\nSome police car came and they said, \"Emma, let\\'s go.\" And the women, our \\ncolleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \"Where are \\nyou taking her?\" I say, \"They\\'re going to kill me, too . . . \" And the\\ninvestigator says, \"Why are you saying that, we\\'re going to make a positive\\nidentification.\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I\\nstill can\\'t remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \"Let\\'s \\ngo, we need to be certain, maybe it\\'s not Shagen.\" And when I saw the caskets,\\nlying on top of one another, I went out of my mind.

And that investigator says, \"Well fine, fine, since \\nwe\\'ve identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since\\nhe has seven gold teeth . . . \"\\n\\nOn the 4th they told me: \"Emma, it\\'s time to bury Shagen now.\" I cried, \"How, \\nhow can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he\\'s sick?

It means arson!\" I say, \"What do you mean, \\narson? Don\\'t they know what\\'s going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that\\nthey killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don\\'t have anyone \\nanymore.\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He\\nsays, \"Let\\'s bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, \\nif it calms down, I\\'ll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \"\\n\\nOur trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the\\ninvestigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then\\nat the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. \\nThen they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, \\n\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\" He says, \"Yes.\" \"Well look, here you\\'re \\ndescribing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\" He says, \\n\"Yes.\" \"And now you\\'re telling it differently?\" He says, \"Well maybe I \\nforgot!\" Like that.\\n\\nThe witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going\\nalong Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a \\nVolga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were \\ninvolved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it\\'s unclear\\nwho--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side\\nof the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports \\njacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \"What\\'s your nationality?\" He \\nsays, \"Armenian.\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \"If he\\'s an\\nArmenian, kill him, kill him!\" They started beating him, they broke seven of\\nhis ribs, and his heart . . . I don\\'t know, they did something there, too \\n. . . it\\'s too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he \\nhad an armature shaft. He says, \"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, \\nthat\\'s where I got it.\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he\\nhad already had it. He said, \"I hit him twice,\" he said, \" . . . once or twice\\non the head with that rod.\" And he said that when he started to beat him \\nShagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, \\n\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,\\nkilling someone,\" he says, \"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or\\nnot?\" I said, \"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you\\ncame back to hit him again?\" He went back and looked and he was already dead.\\n\"After that,\" that bastard Tale said, \"after that I went home.\"\\n\\nI said, \"You . . . you . . . little snake,\" I said, \"Are you a thief and a \\nmurderer?\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They\\nwere taken. He says he didn\\'t take them\\n\\nWhen they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was\\nother people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned\\nit, that hasn\\'t been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \"How can you \\nhave the trial when you don\\'t know who burned the car?\" He said something, but\\nI didn\\'t get what he was saying. But I said, \"You still haven\\'t straightened \\neverything out, I think that\\'s unjust.\"\\n\\nWhen they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. \\nIn the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80\\npercent of his body . . .\\n\\nAnd I ask again, why was he killed?

You still haven\\'t offered\\n\\nI\\'ve been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even\\ncontributed a few comments) but this stuff \"I\\'d rather face a knife than\\na gun\" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the\\nsame thing, then I got \\'educated.\\'\\n\\nPeople do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how\\nquickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don\\'t understand that\\nit takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick\\n(within a minute or so) death.\\n\\nThe death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage\\npoints of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are\\n\\'try their luck\\' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly\\nonly in a single direction and it\\'s only advantage is that it is a\\nremote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a\\nspherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.\\n\\nMost people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by\\naccident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for\\na holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only\\nmoderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a\\nDRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out\\nof ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and\\nability of it\\'s wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and\\nstrong.  It\\'s interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks\\nused by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled\\nslashing attacks of novices.  I\\'ve talked to several well trained\\nmartial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up\\nagainst a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as\\nthe attacker.\\n\\nPracticing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing\\nwith knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a\\nknife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their\\nknife attacks in prison.\\n\\nIf you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize\\nthese facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is\\nthe knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced\\nattacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old\\nman with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about\\none and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking\\ncast managed it in two.  I\\'ve seen people close that distance and strike\\nin 1 second.  I\\'m old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3\\nseconds.  I\\'ve seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons\\nthat you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest\\nwith a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the\\npointed end.)\\n\\nAdd to this the \\'fact\\' that hand gun \\'stopping\\' power is largely a myth.\\nExcept in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that\\ndestroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve\\nseconds for a bullet wound to \\'take effect.\\'\\n\\nThis is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman\\nin L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That\\nlady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All\\nfour of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta\\ngirl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex\\nof her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and\\ndestroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball\\nsized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was\\nout of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight\\nmonths!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was\\non her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn\\'t think\\ncivilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.\\n\\nThe moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife\\nattacker, you\\'d better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good\\nalternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk\\n(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor\\nthem.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact\\nweapons.  The target is as large as the traditional \\'center of mass\\' and\\nis more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a\\ncaliber powerful enough to \\'do the job.\\'  Hot .38\\'s on up will usually\\ndo this.\\n\\nRemember folks, the idea isn\\'t to \\'take em with you\\' but for you to live\\nand them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason\\n\\'killing them\\' isn\\'t our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep\\nus alive.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now\\nknow, I can\\'t rightly say I\\'d rather face a knife than an gun.  It would\\nhave to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I\\nWOULDN\\'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not\\nfear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen\\nbehind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do\\nwhatever it takes.',\n",

As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not\\nconsistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more \\nthat faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren\\'t that compeling,\\nso the stories got bigger to appeal better.\\n\\n->\\tNiether was he a lunatic.

Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among\\nthe alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding\\nall other possible alternatives.\\n\\nHowever, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the \\nincomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at \\nleast one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn\\'t one of\\nthe other two alternative is no longer valid.\\n\\n->\\tSome other things to note.

He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the \\n->same.  Hey we can\\'t do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives \\n->over to him.

       " 'Tony-\\n\\nWhile I honestly believe you believe you are doing a \"good thing\" by posting\\nthat piece of propaganda, I believe the more people believe that the more they\\nwill feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people.  I\\nhave seen the film called \"The Gay Agenda\" and along with my church we found\\nit to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of\\neditting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia\\nfamiliar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people\\nare actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither\\nyou nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as\\nmany as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life\\nI have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something\\nobviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are\\ninnately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an\\nabolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not\\nsupport wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian\\nFundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants\\nyour report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed\\nhomosexuality from it\\'s list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that\\nthere are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.\\nI do not feel threatened by gays, I don\\'t understand why others are.\\n\\nThe following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-\\nistries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.\\n\\nTHE FOUNDER OF AN \"EX-GAY\" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO\\n\\nby Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)\\n\\nIn December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate\\'s homophobia rewaa\\nawards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE\\nINDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering\\ndiscontented gays and lesbians \"a way out of the homosexual death-style\"\\nthrough prayer.  \"I\\'d like to give the award back,\" Caligiuri now laughs, \"I\\'m\\nno longer deserve it.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\'s eight year involvement with the national \"ex-gay\" movement peaked\\nwith his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well\\nas Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-\\ngay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  \"There\\'s no reality\\nin it,\" he says, \"I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.\"\\n  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the\\norganizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again\\nChristianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who\\nare just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their\\nsexual urges and embracing Christianity.  \"We offer support to people who are\\nseeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,\" explains Bob Davies, director of\\nExodus.  He ventures that \"about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-\\nsexuality are men.\"\\n  \"Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting\\ntheir time,\" says Lisa Seeley, a former \"redeemed lesbian\" who worked with\\nCaligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  \"These\\norganizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.\"\\n  \"It\\'s possible to change your identity or your behavior,\" says sex educator\\nBrian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. \"But it\\'s really impossible to\\nchange your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,\\nbut they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.\"\\n  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all\\nhell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both\\ntheir romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted\\nby a man he picked up in a bar.  \"I was really drunk,\" he recalls, \"and I\\nwent home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all\\nnight, and the next morning he raped me again.\"\\n  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the\\nhome he shared with his ex-lover.  \"He had another man there with him,\"\\nCaligiuri recalls.  \"I thought at this time, \\'If this is what being gay is\\nabout, I don\\'t want to be this way anymore.\"\\n  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery\\nwith others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix\\'s\\ngay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its\\nfirst public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,\\nFree Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed\\nfor hell.\\n  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks\\nin part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  \"We were listed\\nunder Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,\" Caligiuri says, \"so people\\nthought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out\\nwhere the local bars were, and we\\'d preach to them about the sins of homo-\\nsexuality.\"  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,\\nadding, \"They\\'ll do anything to reach these people.\"\\n  \"David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,\" recalls Peter\\nKelly, a counselor at Phoenix\\'s Catholic diocese AIDS program, \"like that\\nhe knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\'s family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on\\nRaphael\\'s syndicated talk show in 1985.  \"They were relieved,\" he recalls.\\n\"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better\\nthat I should be a \\'reformed\\' gay person.\"\\n  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  \"By the time I appeared on Sally\\'s\\nshow,\" \"I\\'d started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline\\nand tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their\\nfather.  I was horny all the time.\"\\n  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his\\nnumerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he \"used to go to bookstores\\nand get blowjobs.\"  When he wasn\\'t working the bookstores, he was sleeping\\nwith other \"reformed\" homosexuals.\\n  \"I didn\\'t realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex\\nwith one another,\" Caligiuri says.  \"We\\'d go to conferences in other cities,\\nand we\\'d be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody\\nelse.\"\\n  By the time he appeared on \\'AM Philadelphia\\' television show in May 1988,\\nCaligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show\\'s\\nhost asked him if he ever \"acted on temptation,\" his answer was a lie.\\n  Caligiuri\\'s duplicity began to take it\\'s toll on him, however.  He was\\nsuffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating\\nyeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  \"I was too sick\\nto go to church,\" he explains.  \"The more time I spent away from those people\\nthe more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.\"\\n  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local\\nchurch and closed the ministry\\'s doors.  \"I\\'d convinced myself that there\\nis no need in the world for ex-gay people,\" he says.\\n  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (\"I\\'m interest-\\ned in belief systems that aren\\'t judgemental.\"), considering romance (\"But\\nnot with a CHristian!\"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.\\n\"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,\" he says.  \"I want to\\neventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I\\nmay have brought to our community.\"\\n\\n---end article---\\n\\nCaligiuri\\'s tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles\\nof former leaders and founders of \\'ex-gay\\' ministries who have said very similar th\\nsimilar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have\\ncome to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,\\nlike Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \"Lazarus Project\" of West\\nHollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community\\nto bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values\\nof sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become\\nand become close friends with many who once attended such groups as \"Love In\\nAction\" and others, who either once claimed to have been \"reformed\" or who\\nwere too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed\\nin them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of \"sealing\" their\\nnew heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses\\nand bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of\\nnight and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous \"sin\"\\nthrough a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch\\nhas dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-\\ncent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet\\nthe church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow\\ngay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also\\nmrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and\\nfear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on\\nthem, they may even opt for \\'suicide\\' or surgical dampering of the brain\\nfunctions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-\\nplace.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the\\nthreat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington\\'s\\n_\"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact\\nbased books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as\\nMaury Johnston\\'s _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser\\'s _Come Hom!_.  I\\nseriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and\\nself-acceptance.',\n",

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon \\nto be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He\\'ll be throwing out \\nthe first pitch.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it\\'s not \\nAmtrack.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it\\'s not Amtrack?  Well, he\\'s \\ngoing from Union Station, you\\'re right.  Excuse me.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, what exactly are you prepared to do to \\nbreak the logjam with  ??? Senate?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are \\ndiscussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning, \\nand I think that the President is going to continue to make the point \\nthat he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs \\nto be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for \\nsummer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the \\nimportant programs that will put people back to work right away this \\nsummer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be \\npassed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will he compromise, that\\'s the question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions \\nare going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and \\nSenator Dole, let\\'s see what they come up with.  But the President \\nbelieves his jobs program should go forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, would the President be willing to accept $8 \\nbillion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise \\nbeing offered by --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don\\'t know what is being \\noffered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right \\nnow, let\\'s see what happens today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Would he go that far -- no matter what the \\nRepublicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per \\nyear?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his \\nprogram should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we\\'re going to be \\nwilling to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to \\ncome up with, but I\\'m not going to get into figures right now.  Let\\'s \\nsee what happens.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s reasonable to assume, isn\\'t it, from what has \\nhappened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order \\nto get a vote?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more \\nintrested in stopping progress on the President\\'s jobs bill, than in \\ndoing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the \\nRepublicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the \\nPresident\\'s jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, \\nreal jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there\\'s no \\nquestion about that.  There\\'s been some frustration of legislative \\nactivity over the last few days.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So, you\\'ll need to compromise to get your package \\nthrough?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We\\'ll see what happens with the \\nconversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     prepared to compromise --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President\\'s prepared to listen \\nto what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting \\nwith Senator Dole. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he\\'s \\nbeen very successful so far in the beginning of his term.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record \\ntime, in six weeks, and it\\'s a budget which reduces the deficit by \\n$500 billion over five years.  And it\\'s a budget which provides for \\nimportant investments in our future.  Right now we\\'ve also had strong \\npassage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a \\nminority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock \\nand hold up action on the President\\'s jobs program is not a sign that \\nhe is not succeeding overall.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He can\\'t beat this, can he?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The fact is they can do that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop \\naction.  There\\'s no question about that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What are you going to do about it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, what do you know about these alleged notes \\ntaken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears \\nthat the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that \\nwhen they say yes they mean no?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that\\'s a complete \\nmisreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the \\nconversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring \\nPresident Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime \\nMinister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister\\'s \\nbelief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  \\nI mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and \\netiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where \\nhe was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese \\nwere serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t   Are you saying that the President said that when \\nthe Japanese say yes they mean no?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s not -- I don\\'t know the \\nexact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say \\nsomething along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime \\nMinister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the \\nJapanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and \\nthere appears to be --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'ve seen the reports in the \\nJapanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It \\ndoes talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of \\nview.  I don\\'t think it\\'s going to be a problem.  I believe that \\nthere may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up \\nbut I\\'m not positive.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, was the specific comment that was made \\nspecific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general \\nobservation on Japanese etiquette?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The specific comment is what I\\'m asking about that \\nhas alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, \"when the \\nJapanese say yes they mean no.\"\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean \\nI don\\'t think that\\'s the whole sentence.  I think that the specific \\ncomment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific \\nfinish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that \\nPrime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was he saying it facetiously first?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual \\nobservation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to \\nclear it up.  Has the President sent a message?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don\\'t think the President \\nspoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but \\nI\\'m not sure exactly how many.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you\\'re \\nmaking it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got \\nthe reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that \\nit was understood and make sure there was absolutely no \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the \\nSecretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure \\nthere is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don\\'t believe there is \\non.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they \\nmay have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese \\nis as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two \\ndays.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime \\nMinister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. \\nposition, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the \\nKuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa\\'s \\ncommitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a \\nconstructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to \\nhear that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq \\nfor the last few days, I\\'m a little confused.  What is the U.S. \\npolicy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s the same policy that Secretary \\nChristopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have \\nreiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance \\nwith all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, \\nSaddam can\\'t stay in office?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that\\'s -- our \\njudgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with \\nthe resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that \\nwe expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will \\ncontinue to demand it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And are you concerned the Iran will become the \\ndominant power in the area --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also \\nspoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect \\nfull Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping \\nsupport of terrorism.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That\\'s a very glib statement that he won\\'t stay in \\npower if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you \\nbase that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not \\ncomplying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the \\nrights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is \\nnot fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  \\nHe is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding \\narmaments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he \\nwould be out of power?\\n\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on \\nthe repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make \\nit more difficult for him to stay in power.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it \\nthat you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure \\npolitics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence \\ndo you have that they just don\\'t have a genuine idealogical \\ndifference with you that\\'s in good faith?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times \\nin the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the \\nfight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now \\nseek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate \\nRepublicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to \\nthem during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had \\none, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate \\nRepublicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and \\nthinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -\\n-\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I\\'m not sure that it\\'s true \\nthat there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the \\nRepublican leadership on at least two occasions before the \\nintroduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate \\nRepublican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are \\ncontinually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who \\nhave an interest in the President\\'s package.  We are interested in \\nwhat they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is \\nimportant, and we\\'re going to continue to fight for it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats \\nalone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it \\nthrough?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is \\nno question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can \\nfrustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  \\nYou only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going \\nand to stop any action, and that\\'s what the Republicans are doing.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     going to rethink the way you attempt to get \\nother things passed as you go through this process for the rest of \\nthe summer?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     work with Republicans and try to woo some \\nRepublicans into your camp?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we\\'re going to continue to \\nlook for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the \\nPresident\\'s intiatives?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But on this one -- how are you going to do it \\ndifferently than you did it on this one because on this one you \\nreally did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear \\nthat it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and \\ncould get it through and you really didn\\'t need Republican votes?  \\nAre you going to take a different tack when you have to go for \\nparticular votes?  When you have to go through --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can\\'t see into the future and \\nunderstand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the \\nPresident\\'s going to continue to reach out when he can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You don\\'t have any regrets then about the way you \\nhave handled it up to now and you don\\'t plan any changes in your \\napproach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this \\nexperience?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like \\nhis package passed as quickly as possible and he\\'s going to continue \\nto press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, \\nthere\\'s not question about that.  And we\\'ll continue to reason with \\nthem and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this \\ncase the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around \\na plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  They\\'re being denied any other legislative means of \\nputting their proposals forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they\\'re being --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     any ideas.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being \\ndefeated; I don\\'t know that they\\'re being denied.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     to present them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s not exactly true.  I mean \\nthey get the votes --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     that theirs can be passed though by the \\nparliamentary rules under which they\\'re playing.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in \\nsupport all the way around, no, that\\'s not exactly true.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration \\nbacking any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we\\'re pressing for \\nIraqi compliance.  I don\\'t know if we can get into the business of \\ngrooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at \\nsome levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don\\'t know  about \\nanything recently.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the \\nPresident\\'s best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be \\nsome kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the \\nPresident, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider \\nsomething like that, or any other kind of intervention there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President \\nappointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a \\nspecial envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around \\nthe California economic situation, including the situation in Los \\nAngeles.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles \\nby the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, \\nMr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD \\nSecretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits \\nby Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I \\nwouldn\\'t rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to \\nCalifornia.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is \\nconcerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy \\ndecisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities \\nwhich help prevent disturbances.  But we\\'re going to continue to \\nwatch it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also \\nsupposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a \\ngroup of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball \\nmanagement.  Does the President have a position on that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received \\ncorrespondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson \\nhas also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  \\nHe clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in \\nbaseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the \\nPresident intends to continue to go to the ball game.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see \\nReverend Jackson while he\\'s out there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if he is going to see \\nthem, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has \\nraised some serious questions, and it\\'s something that, as I said, \\neven though there has been progress, it\\'s clearly not enough.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball \\ngame?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure about that.  I believe \\nthe characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an \\ninformational pickett.  I don\\'t know that he asked him not to go to \\nthe ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining \\nhis concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the \\nPresident read it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the \\nmanaging partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be \\nthere, and is he going to meet with the President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is the Mubarak schedule?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is \\ncoming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a \\nlunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice \\nPresident Gore.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And joint statements tomorrow --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, \\nyes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did \\nwarn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist \\nactivities?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, \\nI mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been \\ngeneral conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a \\nlong period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I \\nmean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there \\nwas no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  \\nThe President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also \\nreiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, \\napparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, \\nforgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at \\nthe moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in \\ntheir attempts to get some kind of action.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t know if I would \\nagree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did \\nsay that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a \\nnetwork in the United States and upon which we took appropriate \\naction.  But there was no specific information on this specific \\noperation at all.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So, the White House doesn\\'t feel that any of the \\nlaw enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have \\nreceived this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in \\nnot pursuing some kind of --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR.

And even if there wasn\\'t, what \\ndoes the U.S. do next?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going \\nto move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our \\nallies on a sanctions resolution and we\\'ll continue to look for ways \\nto press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an \\nagreement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, why do you think sanctions is still an \\noption?

The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When \\ndoes no mean no and you have to do something different?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something \\ndifferent.  We\\'re moving forward on further sanctions through the \\nU.N. and those discussions will continue.  We\\'re going to continue to \\ntry and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every \\nopportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? \\nMR.

He believes -- he\\'s going to try and get it this \\nweek and he\\'s going to review the list, and we\\'re going to take a \\nhard look at it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But they\\'re making it up?  I mean it\\'s no White \\nHouse involvement, Congress is compiling this list?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he\\'s going to talk to the \\ncongressional leaders about compiling the list but I\\'m certain we\\'ll \\nbe able to get our own researchers working as well.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, isn\\'t lifting the arms embargo more of a \\nprobability than a possibility?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s something that\\'s under \\ndiscussion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Secretary Christopher has said that it\\'s a matter \\nof time and -- for months before that happens.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it\\'s \\nsomething that the President is reviewing.  Right now we\\'re working \\nwith our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we\\'ll \\ncontinue to review other matters.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule \\nthis week?  Any travel?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I \\ndon\\'t have anything more beyond tomorrow\\'s visit with Mubarak right \\nnow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish \\nAmerican organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR.

       " 'April 16, 1993\\n\\nINITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL\\n\\nThe Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on\\ncryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of\\nmillions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a\\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as\\nexport controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to\\nrobust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.\\n\\nHowever, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already\\nreached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any\\npublic comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the\\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone\\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the\\nNational Security Agency.  The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit,\\nsplit key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips\\nmanufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would\\nstore users\\' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon\\npresentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be\\nclassified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for\\nincorporation into its communications products.\\n\\n     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\\n\\nFirst, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an\\ninquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure\\nproduct. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.\\nFurthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for\\nthe Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers\\nshould be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.\\n\\nSecond, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the\\nAdministration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF\\nbelieves that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The\\npublic will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is\\nopen to independent, expert scrutiny.  \\n\\nThird, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may\\nprove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement\\nneeds, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is\\nadopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? \\nDoes disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual\\'s Fifth\\nAmendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few\\nof the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to\\nanswer.\\n\\nIn sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance\\nof these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy\\nand security.  However, the \"Clipper Chip\" solution ought to be\\nconsidered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the\\ndiscussion even begins.\\n\\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\\n\\nESCROW\\n\\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom\\nhold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device\\nwould be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow\\nagents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.\\n\\nUpon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would\\nhave to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to\\nthe Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be\\nasked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration\\nhave suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the\\nFederal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,\\nbut there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.\\n\\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\\n\\nThe Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which\\nthe government or others could break the code without securing keys from\\nthe escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no\\nback doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,\\nAdministration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto\\ncracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the\\nalgorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be\\nmade public.\\n\\nThe Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,\\nsecret contract between the National Security Agency and two private\\nfirms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for\\nabout four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.\\n\\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\\n\\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes\\nin the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers\\nfor this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al\\nGore, and maybe even the President.  At today\\'s Commerce Department press\\nbriefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any\\nprivate organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had\\nno independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?\\n\\nCOMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY\\n\\nThe Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an\\ninquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,\\nand law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export\\ncontrols on encryption technology and the FBI\\'s Digital Telephony\\nProposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the\\nNational Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential\\nDirective describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement\\nin the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.\\n\\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\\n\\nJerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org)\\nDaniel J.

       " 'Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday\\n     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four\\ngame series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.\\n\"What could be better,\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs\\nare challenging?\\n     \"It\\'s pitching, it\\'s always been pitching that we\\'ve lacked,\" announced\\nRyne Sandberg.  \"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or\\nBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we\\'ll know we might be able to\\nwin.\\n     \"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\"\\n     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete\\nRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut\\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw\\nto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.\\n     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to\\nthird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\\nbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\\nyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a\\ngap in right-center.  \"Cool Papa\" Bell\\'s speed allowed him to cut the ball off\\nand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone\\ngrounded out to second, ending the threat.  \\n     \"Teams are starting to realize that you don\\'t have to pitch to Schmidt or\\nTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on\\nKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells\\nRose at first), and it\\'s a credit to the Phillies that they\\'ve been able to\\nsustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\"  So came the\\nanalysis from Frank Chance.\\n     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas\\' grounder\\nmoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled\\nhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it\\n3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein\\nsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped\\nout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,\\nWilliams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.\\nHe fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting\\nfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into\\na 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a\\nstrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick\\nTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a\\npop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The\\nCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.\\n     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get\\nanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock\\nplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen\\nwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against\\nLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving\\nhome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added\\nanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen\\nhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more\\nruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.\\n     Sunday\\'s twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one\\npoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off\\nRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but\\nthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce\\nSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the\\neighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would\\nconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st\\n     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.\\nThe Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren\\'t among the\\nall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first\\nfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of\\nfirst in this wacky season.\\n     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2\\nSaturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.\\nThe Cards captured Monday\\'s game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve\\nRogers 3-2.  \"We\\'re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our\\nteam speed,\" remarked Lou Brock.  \"I don\\'t see why we can\\'t win this\\ndivision.\"\\n     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of\\nthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,\\nnow 2 back - but in 4th!\\n    \"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a\\npitcher\\'s park like this,\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith\\nHernandez added that \"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,\\nand it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\"  The Pirates have made only\\n26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend\\nto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.\\n     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone\\nSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When\\nNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the\\nPirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the\\n.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert\\nBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed\\nfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home\\nruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph\\nKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets\\' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the\\ntop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie\\nWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on\\nfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent\\nTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in\\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing\\nStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the\\nPirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve\\nallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right\\nfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered\\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep\\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\\nhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,\\nand had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): \\n    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants\\nmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting\\npitching that just wouldn\\'t tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,\\n\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\"\\n     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and\\nthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel\\nfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves\\' park had been a homer\\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\\nWillie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don\\nBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had\\none each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday\\'s\\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\\nNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the \\'61 Yankees\\' pace.\\nThey had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after\\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but\\nfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.\\n     In the doubleheader, the Braves\\' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\\nfirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the\\nBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\\nThe homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to\\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell\\nBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather\\ngood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the\\ntrade looked even better.  McGriff\\'s batting average was even rising.  Of\\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the\\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\\n     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two\\nhome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray\\nNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel\\nPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was\\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after\\n10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working\\nhis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and\\nJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,\\nand the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the\\nGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly\\nemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):\\n     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\\nwide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in\\nthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \"Normally,\" Drysdale remarked, \"I\\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can\\'t afford\\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can\\'t\\nafford to let the Astros beat us.\"  He then winked and said: \"Well, maybe\\nDavis will get decked once.\"\\n     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is\\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is\\nthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of\\nthe nastness of the Astros\\' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The\\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\\nwith center field at 420 feet.  \"It\\'s as if some three-year-old threw a\\ntantrum and told his playmates: \\'If I can\\'t hit home runs, nobody will hit\\nhome runs\\',\" remarked Roy Campanella.\\n     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize\\nthe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\\nDavis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\\naccording to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the\\nBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with\\na two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the\\nAstros didn\\'t score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to\\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened\\nto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.\\nWalt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.\\n     \"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\" he explained.\\n     \"How can we do that,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.\\n     \"They\\'re going to be beating the ball down, so we\\'ve got to be ready to\\nthrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I\\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We\\'ll go with\\na shallow infield almost the whole time.\"\\n     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight\\ninnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran\\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\\nthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The\\nDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan\\nRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.

Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context\\nshould be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander\\n-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.\\n\\n>\"... Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, \\n>nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, \\n>nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom  of God.  And such were \\n>some of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\\n\\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\\n\\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\\n\\n\\t\"\\'I am free to do anything,\\' you say.  Yes, but not everything\\n\\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\\n\\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\\n\\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it\\'s a secondary\\nargument from the \\'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God\\'s messengers.\\n\\nI won\\'t deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\\n\\nI\\'m dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\\nof the ritual law?\\n\\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\\n\\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\\n\\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\\nyou can think of to do so.\\n\\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\\n\\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\\n\\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\\nWHY, for God\\'s precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\\ncondemn people you don\\'t know and won\\'t even take the trouble to LISTEN\\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\\n\\nWhy, for God\\'s sake?\\n\\n\\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\\n\\tto condemn the world,\\n\\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\\n\\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\\n\\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\\n\\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God\\'s only Son.\\n\\tNow the judgment is this:\\n\\tthe light has come into the world,\\n\\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\\n\\tbecause their deeds were evil.\\n\\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\\n\\thates the light,\\n\\tand does not come near the light\\n\\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\\n\\tBut he who acts in truth\\n\\tcomes into the light,\\n\\tso that it may be sh0own\\n\\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\\tJohn 3:17-21\\n\\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\\nrejected.

Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \\n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \\n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\\n in the dressing room.\\n\\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\\n easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,\\n Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.\\n\\n The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-\\n Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the\\n task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.\\n Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering\\n that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very\\n well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because\\n of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake\\n on the 1-3 goal.\\n\\n Lines information follows further below.\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n ITALY - SWITZERLAND  1-0 (0-0,1-0,0-0)\\n\\n 1st:\\n 2nd: ITA 1-0 Orlando          15:47\\n 3rd:\\n\\n Penalties: ITA 10*2min, SWI 8*2min\\n Referee: Anton Danko, Slovakia\\n Attendance: 3,500\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n Group B results:\\n\\n CZECH REPUBLIC - GERMANY  5-0 (0-0,3-0,2-0)\\n\\n 1st:\\n 2nd: CZE 1-0 Kamil Kastak        1:51\\n      CZE 2-0 Jiri Dolezal       12:26\\n      CZE 3-0 Petr Hrbek         19:10\\n 3rd: CZE 4-0 Radek Toupal        8:28\\n      CZE 5-0 Josef Beranek      17:07\\n\\n Penalties: CZE 7*2min, GER 6*2min 1*5min 1*10min game penalty\\n Referee: Darren Loraas, Canada\\n Attendance: 10,200\\n\\n The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans, and the German crowd\\n showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.\\n\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n FINLAND - USA  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1)\\n\\n 1st:\\n 2nd: FIN 1-0 Jarkko Varvio      4:00\\n 3rd: USA 1-1 Ed Olczyk          4:26\\n\\n Penalties: FIN 7*2min, USA 6*2min\\n Referee: Valeri Bokarev, Russia\\n Attendance: 2,800\\n\\n I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn't see the\\n whole game).

       " 'Easy vs. Hard .....Easy on who?\\n\\nI had a rare very personal talk with my mother last year.  She said\\nthat when she and my father were raising we four children, they\\ndid not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised\\nin their Norwegian Lutheran community. They felt that we would be\\nalienated from them and it would create problems.\\n  In other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. They\\nraised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable\\ndemands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances.\\n  What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics and\\nnever absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of God\\nnever involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that\\nI may someday be held responsible for the things that offended\\nHim...sins that the \"world\" told me were OK.\\n  My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raised\\nfour extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a more\\ncomplete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justice\\nand punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, many\\ngrave sins. I lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married\\nand divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for\\nchange...but I shouldn\\'t have married to person in the first place )\\nand more....\\n  My parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing\\nus to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by\\naccepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or\\ncounsel.\\n  Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they\\n*did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help souls\\nbecause you must speak up and say what is unpopular and\\ndifficult and what people do not want to hear. You must be able\\nto say what is hard, and say it as Christ would, with love and\\ncompassion. It involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not\\nwant to hear and will stay away from you.\\n  This life is \"but dust\". As long as the comfort of this life\\nis our highest priority, we will fail God and fail those\\nwith whom we come in contact.\\n  I wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, who\\nsupport the \"right\" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality,\\nor who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in\\nthis time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, loving\\nfriend that these things are *wrong*. No one ever told me that\\nwhat I was doing was wrong, and I saw multitudes around me\\nliving the same way I was and they seemed like good, decent\\npeople. (wouldn\\'t kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies..)\\nIt is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayer\\nlife to hear the Holy Spirit than it is to hear a loving friend.\\nThink about this the next time the Holy Spirit tells you that\\na friend is in error, but you don\\'t want to \"cause trouble\".\\nRighteous prayers is great power, but don\\'t forget that we are\\nwe are Christ\\'s lips and hands on earth. Don\\'t be afraid to\\nsimply voice Truth when the situation calls for it.

In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.

For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially\\nimpressive. \\n\\nThe games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and\\nnever recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches,\\nhits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren\\nRychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed\\nto take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think\\nVernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men,\\nas Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King\\ninserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's\\ngame. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no\\nidea how serious - he didn't return.\\n\\nI still think the Flames should win this series, but they better\\nbuckle down.\",\n",

Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.\\nSeveral vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for \\ntheir workstations and X terminals.\\n\\n[last modified 10/91]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  16)  What is \"low-bandwidth X\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?\\n\\nThere are several options for using X over serial lines:\\n\\nSLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP\\npackets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,\\nand implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.\\nMost X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really \\never uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per \\npacket and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully \\nso; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). \\n\\nCSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the \\n40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn\\'t do \\nanything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,\\nbut they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed \\ndata through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).\\n\\nPPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point\\nlinks over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than\\nSLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial \\nline management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for \\nrunning normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire\\nstill needs compression somewhere to make it usable.\\n\\nXRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally\\ndeveloped by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition \\nto using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes \\nredundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and \\nusing LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a \\npseudo-X server or \"proxy\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There \\nare several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:\\n   (1)\\tYou don\\'t *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn\\'t \\n\\totherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly \\n\\tconnected), and\\n   (2)\\tIt reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that\\n\\thave to cross the serial interface, and\\n   (3)\\tIn addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering \\n\\tpackets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for \\n\\tblocks to compress.\\n\\nLBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a\\nstandard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using \\nNCD\\'s XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX\\nwill go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information \\n(e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, \\netc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a \\nStandard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample \\nimplementation available in R6.\\n\\nAdditional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how\\nLBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu\\nin contrib/ in the following files:\\n        XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote\\n        XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX\\n\\n[information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]\\n\\n\\tThere is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton\\'s talk at\\nthe 7th MIT X Technical Conference.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?\\n\\n\\tThe window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the\\nX window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is\\nno single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways \\nfor the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,\\ndecoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order\\n(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):\\n\\n\\twm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3\\n\\tuwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, \\nalthough it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.\\n\\ttwm (old): Tom\\'s Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window \\nmanagers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a\\nre-parenting window manager. \\n\\tawm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers\\nsome features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers\\n\\tcwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. \\n\\trtl: Siemen\\'s window manager tiles windows so that they don\\'t overlap\\nand resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.\\n\\tdxwm: Digital\\'s dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering\\n\\thpwm: HP\\'s window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm\\n\\tmwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit\\n\\ttekwm: Tektronix\\'s window manager offering \\n\\tolwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style\\nGuide functionality\\n\\tolwm (AT&T): ditto\\n\\tgwm: Bull\\'s Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in\\nLisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on\\navahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]\\n\\tm_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape\\n\\tpswm: Sun\\'s PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release\\n\\tswm: Solbourne\\'s swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple\\nGUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes\\nfrom the resources file\\n\\ttwm (new): MIT\\'s new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked\\ntwm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape\\n\\tvtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a\\nsingle-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available\\non archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available \\nfrom export. [3/92]\\n\\ttvtwm: Tom\\'s Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm\\nand provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is\\navailable on archive servers\\n\\tolvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun\\'s olwm. It is \\navailable on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.\\n\\tmvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF\\'s mwm. A beta version\\nis floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a \\nsource license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].\\n\\tNCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look \\n\\tXDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology\\'s terminals \\n\\tctwm: Claude Lecommandeur\\'s (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 \\ntwm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export.\\nVersion 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.\\n\\tvuewm: HP\\'s MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.\\n\\t4Dwm: SGI\\'s enhanced MWM\\n\\tpiewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?\\n\\n\\tIt needn\\'t.  What is probably happening is that you are running your \\nwindow manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X \\nsession runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your \\nwindow manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in\\nthe background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:\\n\\t\\texec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic\\nor any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.\\nYour X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, \\nwhether or not you kill or restart your window manager.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?\\n\\n\\tAlthough no known window manager directly supports such a feature --\\nwhich may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the\\ngeometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something \\nclose) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are \\nlooking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. \\nLook for the application \"xplaces\" on an archive-server near you. There are \\nseveral versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage.\\n[10/90]\\n\\tSome new pseudo session-managers such as HP\\'s vuewm provide for the \\nsaving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running\\napplications and the resource database. \\n[Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]\\n \\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC\\'s session manager?\\n\\n\\tDEC\\'s session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, \\nadd to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:\\n\\tsm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?\\n\\n\\tYou can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \"xset r on|off\". The X\\nprotocol, however, doesn\\'t provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is\\na capability not supported by all systems.\\n\\tSome servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide\\ncommand-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over \\nserver start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the \\nserver with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server \\nfrom MIT with the options \"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\" to reduce the sensitivity of the \\nkeyboard.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?\\n\\n\\tThere is no method of arranging for a particular string to be\\nproduced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful \\nfor moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and \\ndoes not do \"macro expansion.\"\\n\\tSome (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, \\naccept a translation resource such as:\\n\\txterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\\\\n\\t\\t<Key>F1: string(\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\")\\nwhich permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally\\nwithin an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control\\ncharacters in the string, use \\\\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the\\ncontrol character you want to include.\\n\\tWindow managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor\\nhas a special \"remapper\" client been made available.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDavid B.

It appears that in\\na neutral park Bo\\'s HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two\\nhome runs).  Or do they?  What is \"equivalent average?\"\\n\\nOne thing, when looking at Bo\\'s stats, is that you can see that KC took\\naway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, \\nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \\n\\n> That is good.

I thought he\\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \\nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn\\'t\\nwinning.\\n\\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\\nmistake being made (by the SDCN\\'s, as they are known, on this group)\\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\\n\\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\\n\\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\\na player with poor MLE\\'s (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don\\'t (Oddibe\\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn\\'t hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\\nand so on.\\n\\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\\n\\nWhat hasn\\'t been established is what happens when you encounter a player\\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\\n\\nIt hasn\\'t been established that you can use MLE\\'s with two-sport players.\\n(It hasn\\'t been established that you can\\'t, but then statistics is, after\\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don\\'t mean what they usually mean?\\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \\n\\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE\\'s.  But you guys DON\\'T KNOW.  What\\'s \\nworse, you don\\'t know that you don\\'t.  And you don\\'t know that there are \\nother players you won\\'t know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties \\nagain.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.

EDT\\n\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, \\ntwo months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our \\nnational deficit and to increase our investment in the American \\npeople, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget \\nplan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope \\nand opportunity in the country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, \\nwhich would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed \\nthe House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support \\nof a majority of the United States Senate. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get \\nthe economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a \\nfast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  \\nUnfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate \\nhave used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working \\nthe will of the majority on the jobs bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \\nstate and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue \\nis not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking \\nfor full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't \\ncare about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying \\nthe rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the \\ntable and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of \\ndignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their \\nfamilies and drawing a paycheck.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of \\nserving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \\neconomy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working \\nwith the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \\nof the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \\nplan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \\njobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \\nnational needs.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  \\nToday I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \\nsize package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of \\nthe American people. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But even as we make those reductions and the package \\nwill be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \\nminds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is \\nthe need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \\ndramatic rise in violent crime. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \\nadditional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \\nto rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \\nfiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a \\nmatching effort by local governments, this could put as many as \\n10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in \\ncommunities all across our nation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of \\nviolent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many \\npeople have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their \\nhomes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \\nAmerica can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that \\ninvestment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep \\nthe economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no \\nmistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I \\never have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight \\nfor their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to thank the police officers who are here today \\nand tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here \\nthat I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to \\nrehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the \\nsummer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to \\ntalk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement \\nconcern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country \\nto have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and \\na brighter and more peaceful future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \\nlaw enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \\nthese communities.  I have always supported community policing not \\nonly because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \\nbut because it cements better relationships between people in law \\nenforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces \\nthe chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the \\nchances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  \\nI promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put \\nanother 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four \\nyears.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind \\nthe core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the \\njobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if \\nyou will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept \\nthe fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to \\nbuilding our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will \\ncreate real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my \\npart now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want now to give the people who are here with me on \\nthe platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the \\nAmerican people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished \\nAttorney General.\\n  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that \\nthe jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over \\nthe suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional \\ndialogue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --\\nthey wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, \\nI made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's \\na lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- \\npeople have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden \\nof the present system on many of our major employers, particularly \\nmany of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the \\nstrength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision \\nthat would even approach that on that or any other kind of general \\ntax.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you personally believe that the American public \\nis ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I \\nmean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I \\nwill say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the \\nbenefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --\\neveryone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you \\nstreamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that \\nthere's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or \\nover-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive \\ncare in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows \\nabsolutely massive savings to the health care system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The real question is whether you can transfer those \\nsavings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have \\nvirtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I \\nhave no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is \\nthe polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, \\nthey say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an \\naffordable health care system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I don't think that has anything to do with this \\nstimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first \\nand foremost.  They want that more than anything else.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Now that you've announced your willingness to \\ncompromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of \\nyour package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer \\njobs is one.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the \\nhighway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let \\nme say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime \\nbill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a \\nsupplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think \\nwe need to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the \\nenormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately \\nand disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people \\nwith AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be \\ndone.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the \\nsafety of the public depends on that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I \\ndon't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator \\nMitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole \\ncalled me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call \\nhim back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we \\ndiscussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said \\nthat I would not make any statements about any specifics until at \\nleast they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could \\nreach some accord.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been \\nalready, and let's see if they can talk it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator \\nMitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 \\nmillion, that you want that as part of the package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word \\nfor Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator \\nDole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  \\nBut I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I \\nwanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a \\nreformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even \\nmore focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the \\nAmerican people wanted us to address.

(To\\n>reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from\\n>uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical\\n>problems are notoriously problematic.)  \\n\\nOkay, so let\\'s see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \\nof certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \\ncontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \\nextent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \\ntreatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even \\nif uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that\\na treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for\\nfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.\\nIn this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible\\nbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are\\nqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.\\n\\nSECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of \\nevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  \\n\\n\\nI come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a\\nmathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and\\noccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much\\nof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as\\ninformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years\\nnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to\\njust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of\\nthe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for\\nthe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the\\nNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from\\nsubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of\\nscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the\\n*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific\\ninvestigation.\\n\\nOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \"If this\\nhasn\\'t been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical\\nresearch then it can\\'t be of any interest to us.\"  \\n\\nTo me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \"There\\'ve got to\\nbe controlled studies\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast\\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.\\n\\nSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world\\'s most \\nimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that \\nit doesn\\'t take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell \\nwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple \\nvisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that\\nit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is\\nuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially\\na variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral\\ntherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once\\n(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The\\nprocess doesn\\'t need to be repeated and the subject doesn\\'t need to\\npractice it over again at home.\\n\\nNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. \\n(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  \\nTake someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up \\nto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 \\nminutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to \\nthe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a \\nfew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term \\nfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view \\neven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, \\nthere are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best \\nof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed \\nafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done\\nwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast \\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th\\nfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  \\n\\nThe folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\\nmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\\nwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \\nmany of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \\nafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \\nthe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they\\'re not part of the\\nscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \\nfrom scientific acceptance.) \\n\\nThe Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical \\npsychology establishment is still saying \"We don\\'t have any way of \\nknowing that it\\'s effective.\"  \\n\\nThese academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate \\nas anyone could want, of course, but they say  \"Why should I prove your \\ntheory?\"  and  \"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\"  \\nOne academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \\nunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn\\'t \\nbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It\\'s described in a number of \\nbooks and I\\'ve posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much \\ndetail as I\\'m capable of.)  \\n\\nActually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with \\nfavorable results), but it\\'s apparently not acceptable because it\\'s a\\ndoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\\n\\nTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  \\nThis is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \"doctrinnaire\" \\nattitudes about science.  \\n\\nNow maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  \\nIf so, I apologize. \\n \\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

Just to try to get the same people\\nevery year, provide a basic training to new people so they can\\nbe integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it \\nrequires a continually standing committee of organizers.  \\n\\nSince a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and\\ndisipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim\\na \"well regulated militia\" is not well organized.  But I will concide \\na \"well organized militia\" is not necessarily a \"well regulated militia.\" \\n\\nSeveral people have stated that the \"well organized militia\" is\\nwhat is defined under 10 USC 311, which states\\n\\n\\tThe militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied \\n\\tmales at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in \\n\\tsection 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, \\n\\tor who have made a declaration of intention to become, \\n\\tcitizens of the United States and of female citizents of \\n\\tthe United States who are commissioned officers of the \\n\\tNational Guard.\\n\\nThis deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \"well regulated.\"\\n10 USC 311 does not define a \"well regualed militia\" in any way, shape, \\nor form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia\\nThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \"well regualed militia\" as a\\nproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it\\ntalk above \"disciplining all the militia of the United States\" so they\\nfit the \"character of a well-regulated militia.\"  This is what the\\nparagraph states about the associated costs:\\n\\n\\tIt would form an annual deduction from the productive labor \\n\\tof the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the \\n\\tpresent numbers of the people, would not fall far short \\n\\tof the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all \\n\\tthe States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the \\n\\tmass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,\\n\\twould be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not \\n\\tsucceed, because it would not long be endured.\\n\\n\\nAnother quote provide by Charles Scripter is:\\nJames Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \"General Welfare\" clause): \\n\\t\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first\\n\\tto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\\n\\trecital of particulars.\"\\n\\nSo the phrase \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall \\nnot be infringed\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \"a well \\nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\"  \\nThe definition of \"explain\" as stated in \"The American Hertitage\\nDictionary of the Enlish Language\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:\\n\\t1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;\\n\\t   elucidate: \"It was the economists who undertook to explain \\n\\t   this puzzle\"\\n\\t2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.\\n\\t3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for\\' justify:\\n\\t   explain an error\\nThe second phrase clearly does not \"explain\" the first, therefore\\nthe second phrase must \"qualify\" the first.  The definition given\\nfor \"qualify\" is:\\n\\t1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities\\n\\t   of; characterize.\\n\\t2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or \\n\\t   task.\\n\\t3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.\\n\\t4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.\\n\\t5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate\\n\\t6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)\\nSince \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\\ninfringed\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and\\nit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.\\nBy process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since\\n#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it\\nmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \"the right \\nof the people to keep and bear Arms\" gives legal power to the \"well \\nregualated militia\" and this legal power \"shall not be infringed\".  \\n\\nI thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more \\nevidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the \\npeople\\'s right to form well regulate militia, and says very little \\nabout the right of an untrained person to \"keep and bear\" a .50 caliber\\nmachine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm\\n(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun\\nsafety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine\\ngun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with\\nme.\\n\\n-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy\\n-> our Liberties and Rights.\\n\\nI mean \"to destory our Liberties and Rights.\"  Is that why a participate\\nin the discussion of exactly what \"our Libertues and Rights\" are?

       " 'There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre.  In sum, Ezekiel prophesied\\nthat the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of\\npeople living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used\\ndifferently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes\\nhappens that someone says \"My grandson is the cutest baby!\" and then turns\\naround and sees the granddaughter and says \"Oh!  Isn\\'t she the cutest thing!?\"\\n\\nThis person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the\\nworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for\\nfirst.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very\\nobject-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,\\nnobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is\\noften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly\\nliterally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,\\nit is not.\\n\\n\\nTurning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from\\nJohn E King:\\n\\n> The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the\\n> area[.]\\n\\nNo, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from\\nEzekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say\\n\"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff\\nlike that.\"  You would read \"I will make you a bare rock\" and \"You will never\\nbe rebuilt\", and you\\'d conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way\\nto get from `fishing nets\\' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large\\npopulation\\' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.\\n\\nIn other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the\\nprophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal\\nreading, they could read this passage and conclude \"medium-size city\".\\n\\nYou seem to feel that \"Never be rebuilt\" means \"be rebuilt\" -- maybe so, but\\nit is hardly a `clear implication\\'.\\n\\n\\nMr King also writes:\\n\\n> So far I\\'ve seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000.\\n> Let\\'s assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards\\n> we are talking about a one-horse town.\\n\\nWell, no.  That\\'s only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I\\'m\\nfrom.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington\\nresigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but\\nit\\'s at least a two-horse town.\\n\\nBut supposing 22,000 people is a \"small town\" -- it\\'s still 22,000 people\\nMORE than Ezekiel predicted.\\n\\n\\nAnd you\\'ve said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel\\npredicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their\\nvaluables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29\\nEzekiel even quotes God as saying \"he and his army got no reward from the\\ncampaign he led against Tyre.\"\\n\\nLet\\'s ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.\\nEzekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says\\nthat N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.\\n\\nRegardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before\\nthe place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThis post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability\\nto rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.\\n\\nFor example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26\\nby pulling some \"clear implications\" out of hat.\\n\\nWhen Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your towers\", that clearly implied\\nthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers\\nused to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your fine houses\\nand throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\", that clearly implied\\nthat N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.\\nwould \"build a ramp up to your walls\", that clearly implies that N. would\\nspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the\\nwalls.\\n\\nSee?

       " 'I would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows\\nfrom a Novell administrator\\'s point of view.\\n \\nI just got off the phone with MS Access support and was told that they\\n(Microsoft) has decided to implement, as a standard for software support,\\nthe LOCAL setup (described below) as the \"most advantageous installation\".\\nIf this is true and Microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation\\nthen I will comply but I\\'d like to hear it from administrators first.\\n \\nThe LOCAL Windows Installation:\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\nWindows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive (assuming the\\nresources are available).  From a network administrator\\'s implementation,\\nhe/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using SETUP/A.\\nThen install windows on a per/machine bases by running SETUP off the network\\nto install the complete system on the local drives.  In this way, all drivers\\nare available to the SETUP procedure w/o the need to change disks.\\n \\nAdvantages:\\n- Reduce Traffic - Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due to\\n  the local access of main Windows files.\\n- Network independence - If the network fails (and they all do at one point\\n  or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing\\n  and reduce the cost of down-time.\\n- Faster Windows - Theoretically, Windows will run faster from a local hard\\n  drive than over a network.  This may be a hard point to prove if the network\\n  has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster\\n  access than local ones.\\n- A user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about\\n  varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the\\n  Windows installation is assigned to the Workstation.\\n \\nDisadvantages:\\n- Cost - Installing Windows locally requires a significant amount of disk\\n  space.  Workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can\\n  increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent.\\n- Administration - Local windows installations are very difficult to\\nadminister.\\n  New drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of\\n  which would have to be individually installed on each workstation.\\n- Security - Users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system\\n  files from simple ignorance.  This could result in quite a headache for\\n  administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations.\\n- Backup - We all know the problems backing up local hard disks.  The backup\\n  sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly.\\n  Backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all.  This may be\\n  eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable\\n  applications and *not* user data.\\n \\nThe SHARED Windows Installation\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\nWindows is fully installed to a network disk via the SETUP/A procedure\\ndescribed above.  Users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of\\nfiles to individual \"user\" directories.  These directories may be on a\\nlocal hard disk or perhaps a network \"home\" directory.  The bulk of the\\nWindows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory\\n(some 400+ files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughout\\ntheir Windows session.  The user\\'s files consist of a small set of files\\nthat the user has updated during his/her Windows session.  These include\\ngroup files, .INI files and other regularly updated files.\\n \\nAdvantages:\\n- A single location for all files makes updates to drives easy.  As\\n  an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this\\n  single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it.\\n- Assuming that the users\\' files are maintained in network (home) directories,\\n  the administrator can easily edit any .INI file as-needed to correct\\n  problems that may arise.  This includes WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI.\\n- Backup of all pertinent files is done easily.  Even if the users\\' files\\n  are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the Windows system is backed up with\\n  all driver updates.\\n \\nDisadvantages:\\n- Network traffic - since all Windows files are being shared in a network\\n  directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the\\n  speed of Windows.\\n- If the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since Window\\'s\\n  is reliant upon the network for its files.  Loss of data usually occurs\\n  as well since users working in Windows at the time of the crash will\\n  usually not be able to save their work.\\n- Although minimal, disk space is still a consideration.  If the users\\' files\\n  are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a\\n  significant utilization of disk space due to their personal Windows\\n  files alone.\\n- Users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation\\n  hardware are similar.  This is due to the Windows installation being\\n  tied to a particular username (in the case of Network user files).\\n  \\nThe Discussion\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\nI would like to know, from other administrators with a large Windows\\nuserbase, how they prefer setting up Windows.  Personally, I have\\nsetup numerous installations using the SHARED setup.  All Windows and\\napplication files are on the network with little or no utilization of\\nlocal hard disks.  In fact, I sold a network on the fact that the\\ncompany would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations\\nand thus save that much more money.\\n \\nI would also like to see recommendations for applications.  Should\\napps such as Word and/or Excel be installed locally regardless of how\\nWindows is installed?  Again, I keep all files on the network for easy\\nbackup and administration but this is \"putting all eggs in one basket\";\\nif the network crashes, work comes to a halt.',\n",

Some of their part numbers are:\\n\\n\\t\\t   50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121)\\n\\t\\t   62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136)\\n\\t\\t   66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137)\\n\\n\\t   Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit.\\n\\n\\t   There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a\\n\\t   Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's)\\n\\t   \\n\\tSocket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as\\n\\t   a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins\\n\\t   from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.\\n\\n\\tCooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a \\n\\t   must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had\\n\\t   a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which\\n\\t   tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up \\n\\t   something similar or risk frying your CPU.\\n\\t   \\nProcedure\\n\\n1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.\\n\\n2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and\\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\\n    this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from\\n\\tthe back of the mac.\\n \\n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\\n    need release.\\n \\n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\\n    to release it.\\n                                            \\n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\\n\\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\\n    here.\\n\\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\\n\\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\\n\\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\\n\\n8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic\\n    device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle,\\n\\trear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release.\\n\\t\\n9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to\\n    free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case.\\n\\t\\n10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of\\n    the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic\\n\\tPower light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The\\n\\tmotherboard then comes directly out.\\n\\t\\n11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the\\n    CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators\\n\\tmust be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation.\\n\\t\\n\\tVery carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of\\n\\tthe pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure\\n\\tyour desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board.\\n\\t\\n\\tI used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is\\n\\tNOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is\\n\\ta multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without\\n\\tproper care.\\n\\t\\n12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.\\n\\n13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the\\n\\told clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the\\n\\tsocket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new\\n\\t50 mhz clock.\\n\\t\\n14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification.\\n\\t\\n14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.\\n\\n15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother\\n    board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard.\\n\\t\\n16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\\n\\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\\n\\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\\n    into place.\\n\\t\\n17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\\n    DRIVE CABLE.\\n\\n18) Replace the phillips head screw\\n\\n19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\\n\\n20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.\\n\\n21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn \\n    on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't,\\n\\tsomething is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your\\n\\thandiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences.\\n\\t\\n\\tHopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and\\n\\treplace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and\\n\\tbe astounded. \\n\\t\\n\\tYou will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding\\n\\ta particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up\\n\\tmight take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since\\n\\tmodifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single\\n\\tproblem.\\n\\t\\nGood Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real\\nrisk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than\\n$50 in parts.\",\n",

The Cryptography \\nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \\nevery 21 days.\\n\\n\\n\\nContents:\\n\\n* What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?\\n* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\\n* How does one go about cryptanalysis?\\n* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?\\n* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?\\n* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it\\n  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?\\n* Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are\\n  relatively easy to break?\\n\\n\\n* What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?\\n\\n  The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted\\n  acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A\\n  by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone\\n  who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.\\n\\n  A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so\\n  that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is\\n  the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art\\n  of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when\\n  you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both\\n  cryptography and cryptanalysis.\\n\\n  The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is\\n  called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert\\n  plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert\\n  ciphertext into plaintext.\\n\\n  A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The\\n  algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,\\n  Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different\\n  values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.\\n\\n  The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are\\n  called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,\\n  eavesdroppers, or third parties.\\n\\n* What references can I start with to learn cryptology?\\n\\n  For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given\\n  in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,\\n  concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,\\n  these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has\\n  developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and\\n  mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is\\n  encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up\\n  to the mid-60's.\\n\\n  Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or\\n  Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want\\n  to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common\\n  mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.\\n\\n  The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of\\n  many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently\\n  several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The\\n  book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range\\n  of security including encryption algorithms, database security,\\n  access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments\\n  apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].\\n\\n  The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite\\n  technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in\\n  the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of\\n  DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses\\n  of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on\\n  modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management\\n  and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and\\n  networks.\\n\\n  The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on\\n  the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.\\n\\n* How does one go about cryptanalysis?\\n\\n  Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of\\n  analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern\\n  finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available\\n  textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series\\n  [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for\\n  the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given\\n  systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the\\n  cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still\\n  classified.\\n\\n  Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,\\n  or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare\\n  of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the\\n  most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.\\n\\n* What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?\\n\\n  In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can\\n  find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.\\n\\n  Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding\\n  ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the\\n  plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or\\n  decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.\\n  Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this\\n  brute-force search is impractical.\\n    \\n  Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered\\n  practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years\\n  now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with\\n  this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the\\n  mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic\\n  decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel\\n  machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.\\n  Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].\\n\\n  One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a\\n  brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.\\n\\n* What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?\\n\\n  The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key\\n  rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.\\n\\n  A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The\\n  unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of\\n  ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and\\n  if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount\\n  of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is\\n  probably strong.\\n\\n  A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears\\n  random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).\\n    \\n  A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A\\n  system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.\\n\\n  If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily\\n  strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.\\n  However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is\\n  strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then\\n  he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring\\n  integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.\\n\\n* If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it\\n  guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?\\n\\n  Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical\\n  cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your\\n  ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might\\n  assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is\\n  correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the\\n  rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same\\n  plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus\\n  he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he\\n  doesn't have a chance.\\n\\n  Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,\\n  for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even\\n  chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into\\n  the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See\\n  [KAH67].\\n  \\n* Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are\\n  relatively easy to break?\",\n",

I don\\'t really know the difference\\n|> between the various Protestant denominations.\\n \\nHere in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like they\\nthink of choosing a car or a country club. What I mean is that our \\nculture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather\\nthan considering things with others in mind and not making prayer \\nan initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend to\\ntreat church as they would a club and when something is less than to\\ntheir liking, off they go to another one.\\n\\nI think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different \\nperspective on the \"church choosing process\". It seems to me from 1Cor 12\\nthat God doesn\\'t subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all\\nbut that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a better\\nquestion is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where\\nGod is trying to place me.\\n\\nIf a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they\\ngo to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family of\\nGod. People should hop around from church to church as often as they\\nhop from natural family to family.\\n\\nIf you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an \\neasily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are more\\nlike an orphan. Prayerfully go and \"leave yourself on a few doorsteps\"\\nand see if anyplace feels like home. \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t expect that God want to place you in a church where you\\nhave difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other hand\\nthere are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of looking\\nfor problems you will both find them and make them. On the other hand\\nif you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread that\\nwherever you go. \\n\\nIn general, I think that God will try to place you in a church that\\ntalks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is\\nexpanding on that base.',\n",

Therefore, even if this\\nreligion does not take off, its founding members will be very important\\nhistorically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become \\ncommon.\\n\\nThe basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional\\nmorality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible\\'s\\naccounts of the facts and historical events is correct.\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\nStory of Adam and Eve:\\nAdam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited\\nsupply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says\\nnot to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide \\nin bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.\\n(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in\\nthe bushes that might have angered God.)\\n\\nTraditional Philosophy:\\n1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will\\nprovide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it\\'s OK. This\\nis why married women usually didn\\'t work until recent decades.\\n2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler \\nand slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without \\nquestion by ordinary people, who can\\'t make decisions for themselves.\\n\\nInterpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:\\nThey were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God\\ntold them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were\\nobligated to do whatever their \"Father\" said to.  Being forced to leave the \\nGarden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.\\n\\nLessons from Traditional Interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.\\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is ideal.  Get-\\nting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.\\n3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.\\n4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and \\nshould do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for \\nthemselves.\\n5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from\\nlearning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.\\n\\n1990\\'s philosophy:\\n1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless\\nnamed \"Hillary Clinton\" or \"Murphy Brown\".\\n2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people \\n(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.\\n\\nInterpretation of events based on current philosophy:\\nThey were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge\\nrather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge\\nand (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-\\nselves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were \\nREWARDED by being allowed into the \"real world.\"\\n\\nLessons from new interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.\\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is at best\\na temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn\\nis ideal.\\n3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.\\n4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and\\nshould consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and \"alter\\nor abolish\" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.\\n5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge\\nbut should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children \\nwithout good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better\\nlife for their children (and themselves).\\n\\nI have tentatively named this new philosophy \"The Church of Eveism\" because\\nEve\\'s decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind\\'s first good decision, instead\\nof its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly\\na protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek \\nknowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the\\ndecision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention\\nand desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it \\nuntil it was actively sought.\\n\\n---End serious discussion.

Faith is a possible response to hearing God\\'s word preached.  Kids\\n   are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to\\n   respond to God\\'s word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot\\n   be raised in baptism to a new life.\\n\\nCatholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently, and that\\'s\\none primary reason why they baptize babies.  They believe that Baptism\\nproduces a change in the soul of the baby, quite independently of any\\nvolitional act on the part of the baby.  This change in the baby\\'s\\nsoul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have\\nwithout Baptism.  Since the infant does not have the use of his\\nintellect and will yet, these new faculties are dormant.

       " 'THE HAMAS WAY of DEATH\\n \\n     (Following is a transcript of a recruitment and training\\nvideotape made last summer by the Qassam Battalions, the military\\narm of Hamas, an Islamic Palestinian group. Hamas figures\\nsignificantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israel\\ndeported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to\\nHamas\\'s kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer\\nversion appears in the May issue of Harper\\'s Magazine, which\\nobtained and translated the tape.)\\n \\n     My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a\\nrefugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished\\nhigh school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work\\nfor Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I\\'m married and I have\\ntwo daughters.\\n     The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine\\nexplicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is\\nPalestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and\\nwomen have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli]\\nSecurity Services.\\n     Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation,\\ncooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most\\nimportant objective must be to put an end to the plague of\\ncollaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and\\ninterrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose\\nthe methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into\\ncollaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally,\\nwe confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.\\n     We don\\'t execute every collaborator. After all, about 70\\npercent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into\\ntheir misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is\\nbased on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many\\ncollaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli\\nBorder Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once.\\nHe\\'s as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an\\nIsraeli soldier.\\n     There\\'s another group of collaborators who perform an even\\nmore loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men\\nand women in blackmail schemes that force them to become\\ncollaborators. I regard the \"isqat\" [the process by which a\\nPalestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as\\ngreater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is\\nguilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious\\nduty to execute him.\\n     A third group of collaborators is responsible for the\\ndistribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the\\nSecurity Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their\\nvictims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and\\nimpossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the\\ndrugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.\\n     In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of\\nuncovering collaborators, We can\\'t afford to abduct an innocent\\nperson, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished\\nforever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after\\nevidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If\\nafter interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any\\ndoubt, then he is executed.\\n     In many cases, we don\\'t have to make our evidence against\\ncollaborators public, because everyone knows that they\\'re guilty.\\nBut when the public isn\\'t aware that a certain individual is a\\ncollaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for\\nevidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be\\nirrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually\\nobtained in the form of a confession.\\n     At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start\\noff by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell\\nhim that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the\\nlast moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the\\ninformation we need.\\n     We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has\\nbeen a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them\\nconfess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply\\npressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts\\nconfess as well.\\n     Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an\\ninterrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working\\nfor the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself\\nconfessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the\\ninformation to us. In addition, three members of his network of\\ncollaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this\\nmuch evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are\\nvery careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our\\nprincipal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he\\nhimself confesses his crimes. \\n     A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of\\ncollaborators to decide whether there were any who could be\\nexecuted without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of\\nnames, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not\\nmark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for\\nexecution.\\n     When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But\\nafter we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can\\'t shoot him\\n-- to do so might give away our locations. That\\'s why collaborators\\nare strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, \"What do you\\nthink? How should we execute you?\" One collaborator told us,\\n\"Strangle me.\" He hated the sight of blood.\\n',\n",

Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on the\\nSyclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) false\\nalarms with this system.

       " \"I recently published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash\\nsystem as a technical report at CWI. Being a PhD-student at David\\nChaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research\\nin the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.\\n\\nThe report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be\\nretrieved from\\n\\nftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)\\n\\nfrom the directory pub/CWIreports/AA.\\nThe postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.\\n\\n====================================================================\\nABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash\\nsystem based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which\\nlittle use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the\\nfirst to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the\\nrepresentation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are\\nintroduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and\\npayment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier\\nsystems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in\\nboth computation and communication complexity than any such system\\nproposed previously.\\n  \\nAnother important aspect of our system concerns its provability.\\nContrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be\\nmathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we\\nmake one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the\\nability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the\\nDiffie-Hellman problem. \\n  \\nOur system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in\\npreviously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these\\nis that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be\\nincorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has\\nthe important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the\\nfirst place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender\\nafter the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the\\nmost stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user,\\nwhich seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems.\\nAnother benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have\\nnegligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by\\na simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that\\nprevious solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system\\ncan be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while\\nretaining its computational efficiency.\\n====================================================================\\n\\nCryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!  \\n\\nI made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as\\npossible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to\\nme and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also\\nwelcome!\\n\\nStefan Brands, \",\n",

The Negev in the Year 2000\\n\\nJust after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase \"the\\nJewish pioneers will make the desert bloom\" was trumpeted\\nthroughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David\\nBen-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: \"It\\'s by our\\npioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land\\ninto a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in\\nabandoned desert areas\".\\n\\nContrary to Ben-Gurion\\'s assertion, it must be affirmed that\\nduring the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for\\ncenturies previous, a productive human presence was to be found in\\nall parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys\\nof the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These\\nwere the Bedouin Arabs.\\n\\nThe real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern\\npart, occurred after Israel\\'s dispossession of the Bedouin\\'s\\ncultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the\\n12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the\\nState of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond\\nrecognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev\\nare the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief\\nrole is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture\\nlands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and\\ndumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli\\nJews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area\\ncultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish\\npastoral activity.\\n\\nI. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin\\nbefore and after 1948\\n-------------------------------------------------- In 1942,\\naccording to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba\\nsub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel\\'s Negev, or\\nSouthern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin\\nArabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep\\nand 22,000 goats.\\n\\nThe majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in\\nthe north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per\\nyear. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the\\nBeersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more\\nthan double the area cultivated by the Negev\\'s Jewish settlers\\nafter 40 years of \"making the desert bloom\"*\\n\\nThe Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of\\nbarley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming\\ntechniques were primitive, but production was based solely on\\nanimal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal\\nproduction, although low, was based entirely on pasturing.\\nProduction increased considerably during the rainy years and\\ndiminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture\\nanimals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight\\nquickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many\\nwaterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the\\nresult of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh\\nlocal conditions.\\n\\nAfter the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev\\nBedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The\\n10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of\\n40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150\\nmm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out\\nof three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,\\nspring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin\\nshepherds from roaming.\\n\\nA few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.\\nBut after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these\\nBedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure\\nwas applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields\\nin order that the land could be transferred to the army.\\n\\nNo reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held\\ntoday by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of\\nthe 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized\\nby the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now\\nconfined to seven \"development towns\", or *sowetos*, established\\nfor them.',\n",

However,\\n\\nThis is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were\\nkilled and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder,\\nnot some fictitious \"supression of rebellion.\"  Even earlier, one can\\npoint to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of\\nMuslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the\\nSerbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum \"The Expulsion of the\\nArnauts\" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic\\non March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:\\n\\n   The Mode of Removal\\n   -------------------\\n\\n   [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed\\n   through state terror and \"private initiative\", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]\\n\\n   Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should\\n   distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik\\n   action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]\\n   ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,\\n   if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be\\n   incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the\\n   Chetniks, rather than the army.\\n\\n   There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL\\n   EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages\\n   and city quarters.\\n\\n(Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually\\nall Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism\\nagainst Muslims, aided by Chetnik \"private initiative,\" has continued in WWII\\nand today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book \"Od tradicije do \\nidentiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana\" (Sarajevo:\\nSvjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca\\nin WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining\\ntheir action as follows:\\n\\n   \"Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you\\n   are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not\\n   torture you.\"\\n\\nso the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbs\\nhave repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction\\nof mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the\\neradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs.\\n\\n\\n>>I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda,\\n>>in fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen\\n>>themselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly\\n>>relations.

The last major battles between\\nAustro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the\\nend of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism\\ncame into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the\\nbest Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations \\nto Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian\\nnationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As\\nfor your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim\\nalliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such as\\nyours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.  \\n\\n>\\tI should add few more things.  A.J.

Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats\\nand Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are\\nunstable.  I\\'m working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and\\nMuslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.  \\nYou are wrong if you think only \"image\" is at stake here.  Croatia has\\na deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.  \\n\\nI think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice \\nat this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before \\nany open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will\\nsurvive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse\\noff.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not\\nsee it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left?\\nIf not, then all bets are off.\\n\\nMr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.

I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.\\n \\nIt is apparent to me that those who drafted the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \"Big Brother Proposal\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \"experts\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.\\n \\nIn addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \"tamper proof\" the key escrows might be.\\n \\nI cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlize the \"Big Brother Chip.\"\\n \\nUnfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \"harmony,\" \"right to encryption,\" and \"voluntary.\"\\n \\nIt mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \"I can\\'t believe it\\'s happening here.\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\"\\n \\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMost Concerned,\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[Signature]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tShaen Logan Bernhardt I\\nuni@acs.bu.edu\\n',\n",

Also I use\\nStacker on the primary drive, HP Newwave (for my wife\\'s use, and she \\nwon\\'t let me get rid of it!), and a product called Infinite Disk from \\nChili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom \\nused offline files.  \\n\\nI plan to upgrade to NT, when it becomes a released product.

I expect to buy it, tear off the \\nshrink wrap, and use it without hassle (I know, unrealistic, but I can\\nhope can\\'t I, after all, I have work to do).\\n\\nThe advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers, and \\nhardware specific stuff in general.

IMHO, the more likely\\n# explanation is that it\\'s some combination of the two.\\n\\nBased on what, besides your own warm fuzzy feelings?\\n\\n# Here\\'s something to ponder upon:  have any of you gay-bashers out\\n# there ever considered that homosexuals probably deem their sexual\\n# orientation as being a state of affairs that is just as much an\\n# intrinsic and \"natural\" part of their life as heterosexuals do\\n# about their own sexuality?  In other words, someone who is *truly*\\n\\nAlcoholics share that feeling, until they hit bottom.\\n\\n# gay may not be able to live any other way.  Even if they date someone\\n# of the opposite sex or get married, in their *heart* they are still a\\n# homosexual.  Likewise, if someone who is *truly* heterosexual forms\\n# a relationship with someone of the same sex, then they are *still*\\n# a heterosexual even though outward appearances may suggest otherwise.\\n# \\n# Scott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot\\n\\nUnless, of course, the problem is that homosexuality is a form\\nof mental disorder, caused by childhood sexual abuse, as a number of\\nrecent works suggest.\\n\\nIf homosexuals would stop using the government to impose their\\nmorality on others (antidiscrimination laws) and leave our children\\nalone, I wouldn\\'t care in the least what they did in private.  But\\nuntil they get over the liberal notion that the proper role of \\ngovernment is to tell peaceful people how to live, I have no choice\\nbut to continue to point out that homosexuality is not an \"alternative\\nlifestyle,\" but a sickness.\\n\\n# Before:  \"David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets\\n#           the Bible through the barrel of a gun...\"  --ATF spokesman\\n# After:   \"[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets\\n#           [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun...\"  --Me\\n\\n\\nGood signature!\\n',\n",

This is in response to a question about\\nthe Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification\\nup to our Catholic readers.  --clh]\\n\\nThere is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the\\nmention of Mary\\'s _blessedness_/full of grace in the \"Annunciation\" by\\nAngel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28\\n\\n And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto\\n a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a\\n man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin\\'s\\n name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\"Hail,\\n thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed\\n art thou among women.\"_\\n\\nNow, now, hold that line of thought - \"the Lord is with Mary &\\nblessed art thou among women\" - while you read on....\\n\\nIn the book, \"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of\\nDevotion to Mary\" by Peter Lappin:\\n\\nThe _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated\\nthan the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible\\nthat the feast of _Mary\\'s Conception_ under the title \"The Conception\\nof Saint Anne\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of\\na woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter,\\njust as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in\\nemphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle\\nof grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary\\nis the incorruptible timber \"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_\\nof Christ\\'s sinless body\"; she is \"God\\'s Eden, in whom there is\\nno tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\"  Her perfect\\nbeauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her\\npurity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus,\\nshe was hailed as \"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,\\nspotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from\\namong thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\".\\n...\\nAt the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,\\nJohn Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a \\ngreater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all\\nsin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_.\\n...\\n\\nNow let\\'s go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.\\nFrom \"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\" by John A. Hardon:\\n\\nBaptism -\\nConcupiscence Remains after Baptism.\\nConcupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized\\nbut since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to\\ninjure those who do not consent and who by the grace of\\nChrist Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).\\n\\nOriginal gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:\\nIn the light of the foregoing, we see that our first\\nparents were originally gifted three times over:\\n-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the\\n power to think and to choose freely.\\n-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality\\n and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.\\n-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,\\n the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding\\n title to enter heaven.\\nBy their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and\\npreternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without\\nlosing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose\\nfreely.\\n\\nBaptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam\\'s\\nsin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts\\nbut gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our\\nbodies on the last day...\\n\\nGoing back to _Immaculate Conception_\\n(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other\\nbooks but it may be another contribution to the \\'puzzle\\'):\\n\\nGiven the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a\\nnon-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born \\nAND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary\\'s birth but\\nSTILL, the Angel Gabriel\\'s greetings was:\\n\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.\\nBlessed art thou amongst women\".\\n\\nEven Mary was confused about this greeting.\\n\\nMary could very well have possessed all of the\\n_treefold original gifts above_ given to our first\\nparents (Adam and Eve before their sin):\\n    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)\\n    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)\\n    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would\\n                definitely want to be with those He\\n                has made _blessed_)\\n    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)\\n\\nAt the conception, God made Mary _full of grace\\nand blessed_ as the \\'tabernacle\\' for the coming body\\nof Christ and so,\\n\\nImmaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still\\nhas maintained her Immaculate Heart.

    "For weeks, administration officials have been working through an executive action that would dramatically limit migrants’ ability to seek asylum at the US southern border — part of a strategy to try to give Biden the upper hand on one of his Republican rival’s key campaign issues. The action is designed to potentially blunt Republican attacks on border security and preempt former President Donald Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN.\n",

    "Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That’s not happening any time soon.\n",

    "The topic is described by the following keywords: [KEYWORDS]\n",
    "---\n",
    "Remember, extract and synthesize human-readable tags/keywords/themes from the text, capitalized first letters of words. What is the main human-readable theme or subject matter discussed in the provided texts? What is the overarching, high-level theme of the texts, e.g. \"Music\", \"Sports\", \"Environment\", etc.? Please provide overarching themes that tie the different pieces of information together. What is/are the overarching, highest level theme(s) that you could use as a keyword(s)? Prefer single word tags/keywords, e.g. \"Tennis\" rather than \"Tennis Match\", \"Prison\" rather than \"Prison Time\", etc.! Some examples of human-readable themes are   \"Agriculture\", \"Astronomy\", \"Chemistry\", \"Computational Universe\", \"Computer Systems\", \"Climate and Environment\", \"Culture\", \"Demographics\", \"Earth Science\", \"Economics\", \"Education\", \"Engineering\", \"Finance\", \"Geography\", \"Government\", \"Games\", \"Health\", \"History\", \"Human Activities\", \"Images\", \"Language\", \"Law\", \"Life Science\", \"Machine Learning\", \"Manufacturing\", \"Mathematics\", \"Medicine\", \"Meteorology\", \"Physical Sciences\", \"Politics\", \"Social Media\", \"Sociology\", \"Statistics\", \"Text & Literature\",  \"Transportation\". Also, don't give very similar tags/keywords, e.g. \"Wine\" and \"Red Wine\", just give one or the other in these cases. Avoid tags/keywords that are too specific, e.g. \"Serine Threonine Protein Kinase\". Good theme examples are: \"Birds\", \"Species Migration\", \"Air Pollution\", or \"War\", \"Government\", \"International Relations\", \"Politics\". Another important rule to obey - place more focus on the dataset names for theme extraction. And be concise in theme generation, e.g. instead of \"Income Prediction\", say \"Income\", instead of \"Demographic Information\", say \"Demographics\"! Also, extract the theme of the text, what it is about, instead of the type of problem it is, for instance we don't care about \"Regression\", \"Numerical Features\", \"Data Analysis\", \"Data\", \"Outliers\", \"Subsampling\" or things of that sort, but we care about the ESSENCE of the text! Say {\"Themes\": [...], \"Overarching themes\": [...]} and give your answer in JSON format.\n",
