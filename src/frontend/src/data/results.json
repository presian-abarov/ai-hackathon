Just like plants \"create\" oxygen using light through \nphotosynthesis.  It's a much bigger leap to talk about something that\ncreated \"everything\" from nothing.

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\n   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\n   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\n   (for better or for worse).\n\n   I pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\n   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where\n   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\n   a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\n   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\n   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\n   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\n\n   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\n   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\n   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\n   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\n   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\n   \"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\n   frames.\n\n   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\n   for the results I'd been reporting earlier.\n\n   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\n\n   That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\n   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\n   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\n   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\n   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\n\n   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\n   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\n   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\n   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\n   action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's\n   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\n\n   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\n\n   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\n   \"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\n   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).\n   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was\n   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\n   ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this\n   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task\n   switching.\n\n   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see\n   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\n   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\n\n   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\n   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\n   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\n   even more...\n\n   Lawrence D'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\n   Computer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\n   University of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\n   Hamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47' 26\" S, 175^ 19' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\n\n\nI'm afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that\ncan significantly affect QuickTime's playback speed that you may want to take\ninto account:\n\n(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a\nmovie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16\nbit, but other depths are (of course) possible).\n\n(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for \"double size\" scaling, other scaling\nfactors hit peformance much harder).\n\n(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices\nto advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I'm not sure about Premiere).\n\nAny combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size\nis, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also\nmake a real difference.\n\nForgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...\n\n-Peter Lee\n\n ",

When a friend of mine went shopping for a small\nsedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so\nthe salespeople wouldn't give her the \"bimbo\" treatment.\nHer first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan\nSentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what \"we\"\nwanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid\nkept playing the \"let me run this price by the sales manager\".  After\nplaying the \"good salesman, bad salesman\" game, we finally told him\nthat if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps\nwe should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in\nthe sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick\nin the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's \"Don't Get Taken Every Time\" for a\nlist.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \"you'll have to\nwork with us on this price\", also known as \"each time you come up a\nthousand dollars we'll come down ten\", the salesmanager gave a signal to\nhis two sales cronies, stood up, and said \"well, we can't come down any\nmore so I guess we can't help you\" and they trouped out of the room,\nleaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm.\nI'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they\ncan leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and\nI mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering\nwhy they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the\ndoor.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on\nthe desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman,\nand began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few\nsentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line\n(!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call\nanother dealership from \"his\" phone!  I said that since he'd announced\nthat our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried\nto talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our\nvoices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone,\nanyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom.\nSales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he\nbegins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore,\nwe're going next door to the Nissan dealership.\n\nThen comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out\nthe front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom,\ncustomers and all, \"Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!\"\nSo my friend bought a Sentra.",

TORTURE.\n\n/* Written  4:41 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */\n/* ---------- \"From Israeli press. TORTURE.\" ---------- */\nFROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.\n\nNewspaper: Ma'ariv Date: 18. December 1992 Author: Avi Raz\n\nSubject: Torture\n\nTitle of article: Moderate physical pressure\n\nSeveral times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation\nroom in Tulkarm prison, during which he says he was humiliated,\nbeaten and tortured, Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator, a\nShabak agent 'Captain Louis', chatting on the phone with his wife.\n\"At those moments\", Omar said, \"I felt that he was like a\nhumanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beat\nme and say, 'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed\nyourself' and I understood that he was not really a human being\".\n\nIn late October 1992, after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm\nprison, Omar Jaber was released without charges. \"Among the Jews,\nas among the Arabs, there are good people and bad people\", he said\nafter his release, \"but there, in Tulkarm, in the interrogations\nrooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that\nhe is a human being\". Although he left the detention installation\nin Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (\"I sat at home for ten days. My\nhands shook from nerves\"), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He\ngot out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned\nto normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns.\n\nIn contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was released\nseven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the\nShabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn't speak or\nreact. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early\nAugust and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left\nit one day later - dead. \"We have recently received an especially\nlarge number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at\nthe Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators\", noted\nDr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and\nPalestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...)\n\nThe right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan\nSaber Makhlouf, a 20 year old student. In fact, he was extremely\nfearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated\nin Tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper would\nreturn him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment.\n\n(...follow description of tortures....)\n\nOmar, a tall bearded man, was silent. \"I do not want to talk about\nit\", he finally said, quietly. Some time later, embarrased and\nashamed, he spoke: \"Sometimes he beats you and beats you until\nyou'll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. Even the hands of\nanother interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room,\nand the last interrogator says:\" Now you are kissing my hand, and\nlater if I want, you will kiss my ass.\"\n\nThese things take place in an Israeli army detention installation,\nlocated within the military government compound in Tulkarm (West\nBank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In\nearly March the IDF allowed representatives of B'Tselem, the\nIsraeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, to\nvisit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation\nwing. \"The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solely\nunder Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by\nit\", said Lieutnant Sharon Sho'an, the commander of the\ninstallation, according to the internal report written by B'tselem\nmember, Yuval Ginbar, following the visit. Major David Pe'er,\ngoverning commander of the prison system in the Central Command,\nwas quoted in the report:  \"There is an ethical problem here - no\none can enter the interrogation wing\".",

This will probably\ninvolve defining \"spritual needs\" (is it not that clear) and\nshowing that such things exist and how they can be filled.\n\nAnnother tack you might take is to say that \"fulfilling spiritual\nneeds\" means \"acknowledging a \"higher power\" of some sort, then\nshow that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise\nidentical systems that do not. A correlation here would help you,\nbut as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping\none crutch for annother. (however, I do feel that religion is\nusually a better crutch than alchohol, as it is not usually\npoisonous! :) )\n\nI hope with that clarification, my question will be answerable.

[The residue of \n                   the sprouted group will usually weigh at least \n                   SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group.]\n\n               (6) Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for \n                   mineral content.

Sounds a bit\n>>tacky, but hey, whatever works.\n\nAs David Veal points out, this sort of \"promotion\" would be used\nagainst gun owners by the mass media.\n\nHowever, here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area,\nfree, as a community service.  Such a class would normally cost $40\nor $50, so offering it free is a good promotion.\n\nOur Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished\nteaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been\nvery well received.  We get a lot of people who are novices\ninterested in guns.  We even get a few who are anti-gun, but\nfeel they should know something about \"gun safety\" since members\nof their family keep guns at home.\n\nTeaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits:\n\n(1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases\n    firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats.\n\n(2) A \"gun safety\" class is Politically Correct, and likely to\n    be viewed positively by the public and the media.\n\n(3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts)\n    and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a\n    gentle introduction to firearms.\n\n(4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun\n    and become more involved in shooting or personal defense.\n\n(5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners\n    in general.  Our students see that we are all reasonable,\n    non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate\n    the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  Even anti-gun\n    students sometimes tell us they have \"something new to think\n    about\" with regards to personal gun ownership.\n\n(6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun.\n\nOur course is the standard NRA-certified \"Home Firearm Safety\"\nclass, and our students pay only $5 for materials.  We also\nteach the NRA's \"Personal Protection\" class, although the cost\nis higher for that one since we have to purchase range time.\n\nI think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to\ngun buy-backs.",

Jim Brown obviously\nhas possession of the right-wing token.\n\n> Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.\n\n\"In December, former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski told a\nSenate committee that sanctions were costing Iraq $100 million per day, and\nthat the multinational coalition could take all the time in the world.\nIraq, he suggested, was losing badly every day it defied the UN demands,\nwhile the community of nations won every day -- with no taking of life or\nloss of life.\"  -- FCNL Washington Newsletter.\n\n> The world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many\n> innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable,\n> but that's The-Way-It-Is.\n\nWrongful actions of murderers like leaders of the US government, perhaps?\nRegrettable, of course; The-Way-It-Is - certainly not.\n\n> The media is not totally monolithic. ... There are even conservative\n> sources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)\n\nGood heavens! An escapee from Rush Limbot Land! \"Conservative\", my ass.\n\n> And BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was \n> because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being \n> \"so deplorable\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing \n> wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a \n> decisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War, \n> precision bombing was the norm.\n\nBULLSHIT!!! In the Gulf Massacre, 7% of all ordnance used was \"smart.\" The\nrest - that's 93% - was just regular, dumb ol' iron bombs and stuff. Have\nyou forgotten that the Pentagon definition of a successful Patriot launch\nwas when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage? Or that a\nsuccessful interception of a Scud was defined as \"the Patriot and Scud\npassed each other in the same area of the sky\"?\n\nAnd of the 7% that was the \"smart\" stuff, 35% hit. Again - try to follow me\nhere - that means 65% of this \"smart\" arsenal missed.\n\n>                                                       The stories\n> of \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.\n\nProve it. I have a source that says that to date, the civilian death count\n(er, excuse me, I mean \"collateral damage\") is about 200,000.\n\n-s\n--\n   \"No one has attempted to calculate the costs of an execution in\nWashington state, but studies elsewhere suggest it costs far more than\nincarceration.\n   \"California is spending more than $90 million annually on capital cases,\nand until this year hadn't executed anyone since 1972.  Texas, the national\nleader in the number of executions, spends an estimated $2.3 million per\nexecution.  That compares to an average cost of incarceration in Washington\nstate of $25,000 per maximum-security prisoner per year.\"",

    "sequence": "Here are some notes about what the church is to be like and some helpful\nideas about how to choose a church:\n\nColossians 1:15-18\n   A.  Jesus is the head of the body, the church\n   B.  You cannot say \"yes\" to Jesus, but \"no\" to the church\n\nEphesians 2:19-22\n   A.  The church is the family of God\n   B.  The church is based on the Word of God only\n          Cornerstone=Christ\n          Foundation= Apostles=New Testament\n                      Prophets=Old Testament  (see Revelation 21:9-14)\n\n1 Corinthians 12:12-13\n   A.  Baptism is when we become a member of the church\n\nAs for the question of denominations:\n   A.  The Bible teaches that there is only ONE church from Ephesians\n4:4-6, Romans 12:4-5, 1 Corinthians 12:12-13\n   B.  1 Corinthians 1:10-13 says that there should be no divisions in\nthe church.  There should be no following of personalities in the church\n(and in time, their writings)\n   C.  There are so many churches today because of a problem.  2 Timothy\n4:1-4 says that people will turn away from the truth and try to find a\nchurch that teaches a doctrine that suits their lifestyle\n\nHebrews 10:24-25\n   A.  Do not miss church\n   B.  Purpose is to encourage each other, so we will remain faithful.\nInvolved on a relationship level in the church\n   C.  Must come to ALL services\n\nAnother verse which is helpful is Hebrews 3:12-15.  The church should be\nencouraging daily, as it is their duty to do.\n\nOf course, more standards apply:\n   1 Timothy 4:16  People in the church should be watching their lives\nand doctrines to make sure they both live up to the Word entirely (ie,\ndisciples).\n   Acts 17:10-12  The pastor does not come close to the Apostle Paul\n(natural conclusion since the Apostle Paul talked with Jesus directly\nface to face), so if the Bereans, who were considered noble, didn't take\nPaul at his word but checked out what he said with Scripture to verify\nhis statements, then church members are to do the same and verify the\npastor's statements.  If they are not verifiable or valid in light of\nother verses, then that group should be avoided as a church (would've\nmade a wonderful suggestion to the Waco group, especially in light of\nMatthew 24).",

I would like\nto make the program as fast as possible so that it provides\nsatisfactory real time performance on a Sun IPX.\n\nIdeally, I'm looking for a PD graphics package which will allow me to\nopen a new window under X, and allow me to draw lines within the\nwindow.  Also, it would also need to have some sort of event driven\ninteraction handling since the user is going to move around the\nwireframe models using the keyboard.\n\nIf you know or wrote such a package, I would be grateful if you could\ndirect me to a ftp site which contains the package.\n\nThank you.\n",

I think \"The Yeast Connection\" is\n> a bunch of hooey.  What does this have to do with how well\n> nutrition is taught, anyway?\n\nElisabeth, let's set the record straight for the nth time, I have not read \n\"The Yeast Connection\".  So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing \nby this \"hated\" book.  It's okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me?\nElisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th Edition.\nA book that you should be familiar with and not \"hate\". \"Candida species \ncolonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly \nthereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.  \nIndeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic \nmycosis.\"  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic \ninfection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or \n\"sick\" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent \nparasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.\nYour assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute \nit.\n\nWhat I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic \ninfection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation\n(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial \ncompetition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida \nblooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser's again: \"However, some factors, such as \nthe use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to \nboth mucosal and systemic infections\".  I was addressing mucosal infections\n(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers \nthis effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the \"cure\".  I guess that \nyour nutrition course does not, too bad.  \n\n\n>>Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \n>>called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\n>>for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \n>>yeast-like fungus.  \n> \n> Well, maybe I'm getting picky, but I always thought that a yeast\n> was one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the\n> mold form.  Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds, \n> depending on environment.  Candida exibits what is known as\n> reverse dimorphism - it exists as a mold in the tissues\n> but exists as a yeast in the environment.  Should we maybe\n> call it a mold infection?  a fungus infection?  Maybe we\n> should say it is caused by a mold-like fungus.\n>  \n>> \n>>Martin Banschbach, Ph.D.\n>>Professor of Biochemistry and Chairman\n>>Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology\n>>OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n>>1111 West 17th St.\n>>Tulsa, Ok. 74107\n>>\n> \n> You're the chairman of Biochem and Micro and you didn't know \n> that a yeast is a form of a fungus?  (shudder)\n> Or maybe you did know, and were oversimplifying?\n\nMy, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you \nnoticed my faculty rank, I'm a biochemist, not a microbiologist.\nCandida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But, as you point \nout, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells, \npseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist \nand that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it's a lot of \nGreek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me.\n\nYou know Elisabeth, I still haven't been able to figure out why such a small \nlittle organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in \nSci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too.\nI keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what \nI've said, that it will make sense.  I'm not asking anyone here to buy into \n\"The Yeast Connection\" book because I don't know what's in that book, plain \nand simple. And to be honest with you, I'm beginning to wish that it was never \nwritten.",

None\nof your research supports this; no mental health expert has taken this\nposition.  This is *your own* opinion which is not backed up by any\nresearch or any knowledge.\n\nAccording to one survey, done in San Francisco, the number of heterosexual\nmen who were molested as children was on the order of 5%.  The number of\nhomosexual men who were molested as children was on the order of 8%.\nSource:  a book on sexual abuse of children by David Finkelhor (sorry,\nthe title escapes me).\n\nConclusions that can be drawn from this:  none.\n\n> If homosexuals would stop using the government to impose their\n> morality on others (antidiscrimination laws) and leave our children\n> alone, I wouldn't care in the least what they did in private.

You realize, of course, that you\nare approaching the two-year anniversary of your crusade.  How are\nyou planning on celebrating two years of lies?\n\nIncidentally, we are still waiting your crusade against African-Americans,\nwomen, and other minorities who also want to \"impose their morality on\nothers\".  After all, they also want the government to \"tell peaceful\npeople how to live.\"  Therefore, you really \"have no choice\", but to\ncontinue to point out that being a woman or an African-American is not\na lifestyle, but a sickness.\n\nIt's bullshit, Mr. Cramer.  It was bullshit when you began this crusade\nand it's still bullshit.  I am continually amazed at the depths to which\nyou'll stoop to carry on this deliberate attack.",

Ipser, Jr., 1993\n>\n\nHere's my own top ten response to Mr. Ipser's list\n\n\n10.  It's about time we have a President that might actually stand up to the\n     military.  Our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not\n     revolve around them, and that one of the things they're out there defending\n     is our right to be critical of them, even denounce them.\n\n9.   Let me explain something to you.  Environmental policy and industrial\n     policy MUST go hand in hand.  Our nation, and indeed, our planet cannot\n     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years.\n     Our industrial/environmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL! We\n     must have active government support of the key industries such as,\n     telecommunications, microelectronics, medical, biotech, and environmental\n     tech.  Meanwhile weed out old, inneficient, high-polution, industries\n     that are better left to other nations.  This will make us richer, help\n     produce new jobs, and help the environment.  To give credit where credit\n     is due, I heard a lot of this in a speech by Senator John Kerry (D-MA)\n     tonite.  In addition, it's time we get really, really serious about \n     issues like overpopulation, globabl warming, and ozone depletion.  The\n     planet on which we live should be our utmost priority!\n\n8.   It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work,\n     to provide the services that people need, and to help solve the problems\n     that need to be solved.  Granted, some things can probably be done more\n     efficiently for less money, and should be.  But some things are going to\n     cost more money and I'm sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about\n     taxes all the time.  You want to live in my country, you pay your fair\n     share!\n\n7.   I can't believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give\n     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes.  If you're\n     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an\n     enemy which at best doesn't affect us and at worst really should be our\n     friend, then you have no right to tell me you shouldn't pay taxes!\n\n6.   Hey, I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60's-esque touch!\n\n5.   Look, Canada, Europe, and Japan manage to provide health care for their\n     citizens (and, yes, basic health IS a human right which people are\n     entitled to).  If these nations aren't capitalist enough for you, then\n     I guess we've found something better than capitalism!  There is nothing\n     sacred about the capitalist system, and if something, be it socialism\n     or anything else, works better, then I say let capitalism die.\n\n4.   Make love, not War!\n\n3.   Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to be a male and a feminist\n     at the same time.  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity\n     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong, and trying to force\n     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse.  Women certainly \n     have as much to offer this world as men, and the day that gender\n     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of\n     the past few centuries seem like reform bills.  I look forward to it.\n\n2.   See number 10.\n\n1.   HEY MAN, ACADAMIA RULES!!\n\n        \n\n    -Amar Chaudhary\n\n     Peace, Land, at Matzoh! \n     \"AC in DC in 2008!\"\n\nNone of the opinions here necessary reflect the opinions of Yale University or\nanyone or anything associated with it, except for me, of course :)",

I have to consult my city and inform them that it's from\nnow a fishing village. When this city (Kristinestad) was founded\nin the 17:th century about 1000 people lived there, so the norms\nwere even more bizarre for dumb Swedish queens who founded cities\nalong the coast of Finland.\n\nI would like to know why Paul thought is was worth mentioning the \nsmall fishing place of Tyre in Acts. Again, maybe he was a keen\nfisherman and wanted to visit the shores of Tyre? :-)\n\nCheers,\nKent",

Symposium\nproceedings will be published by the Internet Society.  Topics for the\nsymposium include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n*  Design and implementation of services--access control, authentication,\n   availability, confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation\n   --including criteria for placing services at particular protocol\nlayers.\n\n*  Design and implementation of security mechanisms and support\n   services--encipherment and key management systems, authorization\n   and audit systems, and intrusion detection systems.\n\n*  Requirements and architectures for distributed applications and\n   network functions--message handling, file transport, remote\n   file access, directories, time synchronization, interactive\n   sessions, remote data base management and access, routing, voice and\n   video multicast and conferencing, news groups, network management,\n   boot services, mobile computing, and remote I/O.\n\n*  Special issues and problems in security architecture, such as\n   -- very large systems like the international Internet, and\n   -- high-speed systems like the gigabit testbeds now being built.\n\n*  Interplay between security goals and other goals--efficiency,\n   reliability, interoperability, resource sharing, and low cost.\n\nGENERAL CHAIR:\n   Dan Nessett, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\n\nPROGRAM CHAIRS:\n   Russ Housley, Xerox Special Information Systems\n   Rob Shirey, The MITRE Corporation\n\nPROGRAM COMMITTEE:\n   Dave Balenson, Trusted Information Systems\n   Tom Berson, Anagram Laboratories\n   Matt Bishop, Dartmouth College\n   Ed Cain, U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency\n   Jim Ellis, CERT Coordination Center\n   Steve Kent, Bolt, Beranek and Newman\n   John Linn, Independent Consultant\n   Clifford Neuman, Information Sciences Institute\n   Michael Roe, Cambridge University\n   Rob Rosenthal, U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology\n   Jeff Schiller, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n   Ravi Sandhu, George Mason University\n   Peter Yee, U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nSUBMISSIONS:  The  committee seeks both original technical papers and\nproposals for panel discussions on technical and other topics of general\ninterest.  Technical papers should be 10-20 pages in length.  Panels\nshould include three or four speakers.  A panel proposal must name the\npanel chair, include a one-page topic introduction authored by the chair,\nand also include one-page position summaries authored by each speaker\nBoth the technical papers and the panel papers will appear in the\nproceedings.\n\nSubmissions must be made by 16 August 1993.  Submissions should be made\nvia electronic mail to\n\n                   1994symposium@smiley.mitre.org.\n\nSubmissions may be in either of two formats:  ASCII or PostScript.  If\nthe committee is unable to read a PostScript submission, it will be\nreturned and ASCII requested.  Therefore, PostScript submissions should\narrive well before 16 August.

There are also some public domain widgets in the delivery. \n\nThe ICS Widget databook is a subscription kind of thing, where \nyou pay some nominal fee, get a cd with the widgets and then you \ncan use the public domain widgets freely, and selectively activate \nwidgets which you want to purchase the right to use from them. \nThe nice thing about this is that you can purchase whole sets of widgets\nsuch as those used in dataviews.  I dont know there pricing schemes\nbut It is often better to buy than to redevelop the more complex \nwidgets, especially if you only one customer to distribute to. \n\nThis is the extent that I know about them except that I got their \ndatabook catalog  and it looked impressive (lots o' widgets there)\n\nI dont work for ICS or have any widgets being sold by them.\nhope this helps you.\n-- \nBrian Dealy                |301-572-8267| It not knowing where it's at  \ndealy@kong.gsfc.nasa.gov   |            | that's important,it's knowing\n!uunet!dftsrv!kong!dealy   |            | where it's not at...

A dip in the asphalt that you test your\nshocks on at 60 will kill you at 130.

They're very recent, I downloaded them from the \nCirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, \nemail me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.  \nI have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think \nthe drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).\n\nI found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, \nimproving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) \nalthough this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on \nCirrus's part but I don't think so.\n\nFrom Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons \n(also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the \nfollowing for the sake of comparison:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWintach\n             \t\tWinbn3.11\tWord\tSprsht\tCad\tPaint\tOverall\nSteve's system:\n486/33 VLB:\nATI Graphics Ultra Pro\t  9.33\t\t10.34\t 20.78\t8.28\t14.90\t 13.58\n\nmy system -\n486sx/33 VLB:\nVL24 Bitblaster\t\t  9.88\t\t 8.65\t 11.71\t18.84\t15.40\t 13.65\n\n\nIts no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of \nthe ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.\n\nMicron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the \nDTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 \ndrive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, \nI am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's\nsysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at \nleast that was what the program said.\n",

If you would like more info on the ministry,\nand/or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial,\ne-mail to Randy Hunt at rlhunt@hou.amoco.com.\n\n\nLOVE IN THE MORNING  (Psalm 90:14)\n\nby Malcolm Smith\n\nMoses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of Israel. A generation\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\nthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\nat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?\"\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\nmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\n",

This\nis obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people,\nfor instance: according to the Bible, the surrounding people were\nimmoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits.  We need to look\nrather at what those peoples were *really* like.  For instance, in\nwhat way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is\nsymbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of\nwhose presence is symbolically represented in a statue?  By the\nBible's own terms idolatry is inherently evil, but I see no evidence\nthat the followers of the various other religions of the area and time\nwere particularly bad people, relative to the people in the Bible.\n\n>[...scissors and cloth...] Now in the past, our ancestors\n>did cut cloth with scissors, but they at least knew that\n>their inhumane neighbors cut it with their bare teeth,\n>so this was a relatively enlightened step forward from\n>their earlier barbarism, and made the transition to\n>modern civilized paper-cutting that much easier.\"\n\nSounds good, but it presupposes teeth-rending neighbors, which I see\nno support for.  One can argue that post-facto assertion of inhumane\nneighbors can be used to make moral points, but that doesn't mean that\nthe actual neighbors really were inhuman.  More to the point, such\ndehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain, or\neven of a different people dwelling among us, is all too common.\n\n>|> That complex\n>|> and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic\n>|> interpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don't\n>|> think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it\n>|> to attack condemnation of the original history.\n\nNote that I'm speaking of historical interpretation here, for instance\nclaiming that Hammurabi's \"an eye for an eye\" was primitive brutal\nretribution, while Moses' version was an enlightened benign fine\n(because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way).  As\nof 3000 years ago or so, they probably both meant the same thing.\n\n>To be sure, I'm arguing from a parochial perspective.\n>I belong to this tiny tribe which has struggled against\n>overwhelming odds for survival as a distinct tribe,\n>and this book is the book of my tribe.

So there's a kind of nostagia for the old days, before expansion, the Soviet series, Gretzky and even Bobby Orr, when guys weren't afraid to take a hit, nobody floated and defensemen played defence.

In each of these cases, the suspension geometry\nwill suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the\nintended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom\nof the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore\nthe suspension geometry.

    "sequence": "In responding to the post below I have considered issues far outside the\nscope of revisionism and principally have considered the political\nimplications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome. Thus it\nis tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed\nfollowups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political\nlessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.\n\n\nIn article <1993Apr14.121823.21851@oneb.almanac.bc.ca>, kmcvay@oneb.almanac.bc.ca (Ken Mcvay) writes:\n\n|>As Dawidowicz points out, in \"The Holocaust and the Historians,\" (Harvard \n|>University Press, 34-38):\n|>\n|>\"...the nadir in Hitlerology is reached by David Irving's \"Hitler's\n|>War.\"<34> An amateur historian, whose reputation as a German apologist and\n|>as a writer without regard for accuracy or truth won him a measure of\n|>notoriety, <35> Irving produced a 926-page work intended to show that Hitler\n|>was kind to his animals and to his secretaries, that he was \"probably the\n|>weakest _leader_ Germany has known in this century,\" and that he did not\n|>murder the Jews or even wish to do so, but that the murder was committed\n|>behind his back, without his knowledge or consent.\" \n\nLet us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does\nthis mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder\nbecause he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent\nsupporter?\n\nOne of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system\nwas far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party\nitself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was\nnoone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not\noriginaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it\nuntil his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged\nupon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of \nhis supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the\nold guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications\nof their rhetoric. \n\nThis is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must\nbe considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one \"race\"\nof people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of\nhumanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,\nthe gas chambers of Auschwitz.\n\nThe NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who\nlead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the\nevil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.\nHitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego\ncult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however\nmean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and\nhis propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can\nproduce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be \nemphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between\na govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to \ngovern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the\nlatter as a \"strong\" government since most displays of strength are made\nnecessary by an essential weakness.\n\nIt is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they\namoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the\nsame manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause\nof morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their\nlogic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties\nsuch as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert\nthe truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates\nof a system that would commit genocide. \n\nThe conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is\ninescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let\nthe conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that\nwere basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of\nthe concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly\ndoes not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.\n\nNo matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon \nelection those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.\nIf this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made\nthe pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates\na dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many\nin government politics is a method of providing a justification for\ntheir own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A \nrhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the\ncontinued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the\nessential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli\nwhich has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important\nto realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right\nand those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement\nof popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.\nIn the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through\ntheir assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.\n\nIt is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics\nof political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The\nleaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do\nso voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a \ntask without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of\nones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore\nin taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole\nbefore personal concerns, even of personal security.\n\nAlthough it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred\nand an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit\ngenocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of\nthe system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility\nof changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to \ncontrol a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot \naffect the system.\n",

    "sequence": "I've heard it said that the accounts we have of Christs life and\nministry in the Gospels were actually written many years after the event.\n(About 40 years or so). Is this correct?? If so, why the big time delay??\nI know all scripture is inspired of God, so the time of writing is I suppose\nun-important, but I still can't help be curious!\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nIvan Thomas Barr \n\nContact me at u9126619@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk\n\n[The Gospels aren't dated, so we can only guess.  Luke's prolog is\nabout the only thing we have from the author describing his process.\nThe prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to do\nsome investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally that\nsay a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There are\ndebates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don't\nhave the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them\nseriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, and\nwas written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die.\nOne tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words\nmay have been made earlier than the current Gospels.  \n\nIn the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal\ntransmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred\nto hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe\neven from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather\nthan from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a\nperiod when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do\nthink there was some written material earlier, which was probably used\nas sources for the existing Gospels.\n\nEstablishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to\nconfess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods\nused.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64\nAD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the\nCentury.  A few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the\nother.",

    "sequence": "Once again, this posting has been delayed for about a week by falling\nbetween some software cracks...\n\nIn article <114525@bu.edu> jaeger@buphy.bu.edu (Gregg Jaeger) writes:\n>As promised, here is Rafiq Zakaria's discussion of the nature of\n>the so-called \"satanic verses\" from which Rushdie's title has been\n>taken. (Rafiq Zakaria, _Muhammad and the Quran_, Penguin '91)\n\n[Here follows an introduction to the controversial incident, and an\n apologetic explanation purporting to show why it couldn't actually\n have happened.  The historicity of the episode doesn't matter to what\n follows]\n\nI don't know whether I'm quoting Gregg or Zakaria below.  Anyway, back\nto current affairs,\n\n>Rushdie has, by his own admission, drawn\n>on the version given by [the orientalist] Watt \n\nAmong others; this incident is not something Rushdie or Watt or anyone\nelse dug up from nowhere, it is a well known story, a myth if you\nwill, known (according to Umar Khan) to \"Every Muslim school boy and\ngirl\", and so presumably to Rushdie, and to Gibreel Farishta.\n\n>and then allowed his\n>imagination to run wild \n\nYes, this is what writing fiction is all about.  Rushdie was writing\nabout a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing\nthe actor \"Gibreel\" in the role of the angel whose name he took.\nRushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims\nor implies that this is what actually happened.  It's somewhat like\nstories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed\nprostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to the\nArthurian mythos, or the Grail legend, or the Wandering Jew, or dozens\nof others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer,\nconsider Salman Rushdie's children's book \"Haroun and the Sea of\nStories\" for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific\nstoryteller -- works with existing story lines.\n\n>to ridicule Muhammad's integrity...\n\nNo.  Muhammad's [Mahound's] integrity is not really impugned in this\npart of the story, and there's no reason to think this was Rushdie's\nintent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine and\nsatanic), though he doesn't know their provenance.  It is not implied\n(in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:\n\n    \" *Not my voice* I'd never know such words I'm no classy speaker\n    never was never will be but this isn't my voice it's a Voice.\n      Mahound's eyes open wide, he's seeing some kind of vision,\n    staring at it, oh, that's right, Gibreel remembers, me.  He's\n    seeing me.  My lips moving, being moved by.  What, whom?  Don't\n    know, can't say.  Nevertheless, here they are, coming out of my\n    mouth, up my throat, past my teeth: the Words.\n      Being God's postman is no fun, yaar.\n      Butbutbut: God isn't in this picture.\n      God knows whose postman I've been.\"\n\nIt's ambiguous: is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel?  Is it Satan?\nOr something else?  The answer is not given.\n\nTo be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the\nrole of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing loss\nof faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation,\nbut this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.  The very\nexistence of a newsgroup named \"alt.atheism\" raises the same\nquestions, more forcefully, and does propose some answers, which is\nthe real relevance.  If Rushdie's mild fictional exploration is \"filth\nand lies\", and he \"asked for what he got\", are we next on the fatwa\nlist?  (That's a rhetorical question, of course.)\n-- \nJim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC\nThese are my opinions.  For a nominal fee, they can be yours.\n\n",

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments\n\nship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n\t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n\t\t\t compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.\n\t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n\t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n\t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\n\nship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\n\t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\n\t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\nship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\n\t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\n\t\t\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\nship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\n\t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\n\t\t\t for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing\n\t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\n\t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n\t\t\t JPEG's characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\n\t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n\t\t\t Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n\t\t\t of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n\t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n\t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n\t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit's not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\n(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\nmanipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it's functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:\nit's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*\nof them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,\n    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has\n    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\n\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\nNeXT:\n\nImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format\nconversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.\nImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at\nsonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are\ncurrently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specific\nsub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that\ndoes not support JPEG.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\nIf you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\n(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\n\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\n\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\nanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\n\n\n[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?\n\nMost people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you're out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.\nJPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with\nanybody else's.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM:'-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat's a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you'd get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\nimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\n",

This seems ONLY to happen\nto communications programs, but I can't nail it down any further than that.\nNote, though, that the comms programs don't have to be communicating.  Even\njust scrolling back through capture buffers or displaying disk files in\nthese programs causes the problem.\n   \n   Prior to the latest rev of Word Perfect for Windows, WPwin would sometimes\nblow up, and the error message would cite the video driver as the source of\nthe problem.

According to\nthem they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised\nKoresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 \n The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he\nsaid:\n\n\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.\nHis grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise\nDavid Koresh.\"\n\nSomeone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a\nlogical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.\n\nHere's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that\nthey feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must\nbe done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?\n\nI knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how\nmuch money this was costing.  That was the start of the \"Justification\" part\npart of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.\n\nBut, back to the plan.  It is considered \"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\" to\nexecute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.\n\nThey knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not\nsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the \ncompound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were\nsupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.\n\nI spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR\n(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training\nis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were\nsubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical \nagent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.\n\nI have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of\nthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.\n\nWe waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these\npeople 51 days.  \n\nI stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole\nthing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks\nchanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:\n\n\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the\noperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal\nshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\"\n\nIt took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.\n\nOne more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic\nweapons on the premises. \n                                                      \n        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!\n\nTHEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!\n\nStill, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him.\nFor all of this my President takes full responsibility.  What a guy!\nI hope he gets it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It is interesting\nmedically because the normal location of organs is caused in part\nby the \"normal\" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in\nabsence of this, laterality can be \"random.\" People with situs\ninversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their\nrarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they\ncan't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong\nside). \n\nAccording to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal\nrecessive, which should imply that on average one child in four\nin a family would be affected. But there may be much more current\ninformation on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking\nabout more than one conditiion.

One of my colleagues here at GE CRD has done just that\nin our internal LYMB system.\n\nWe have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of\ndial positions from a single set of vectors. Each set of vectors is then\ndrawn into a pixmap. Clicking the button advances the knob's state and\nchanges to the next pixmap in the sequence.\n\nUsing DrawnButtons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular\nportion of the parent widget, but that's normally not a big shortcoming. You\ncan make things look circular enough.\n",

It says that \"The Immaculate Mother of God, the ever Virgin\n>Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed\n>body and soul into heavenly glory.\"  This was defined by a Papal\n>statement in 1950, though it had certainly been believed by some\n>before that.  Like the Immaculate Conception, this is primarily a\n>Roman Catholic doctrine, and like it, it has no direct Biblical\n>support.  Note that Catholics do not believe in \"sola scriptura\".\n>That is, they do not believe that the Bible is the only source of\n>Christian knowledge.  Thus the fact that a doctrine has little\n>Biblical support is not necessarily significant to them.  They believe\n>that truth can be passed on through traditions of the Church, and also\n>that it can be revealed to the Church.  I'm not interested in yet\n>another Catholic/Protestant argument, but if any Catholics can tell us\n>the basis for these beliefs, I think it would be appropriate.  --clh]\n\nIn the Bible, there are a lot of instances where God speaks\nto people, where a person just \"came to know\" some piece\nof information, where a person walks off into the desert\nfor \"40 days\", etc. With all of God's power He certainly can\ndo whatever He wants when He wants it. The Bible \"ends\"\nwith the book of Revelations. But does God's reign end there ? No.\nSo who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longer\nhappening or still happening ?\n\nI can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-)\nWith the cold response I've gotten from the past from this\ngroup, it's very hard to get the point across. I'll only\ngo over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look\nat documents stored somewhere. I've cited the uncorrupted\nbodies of saints before. They're still there. 8-)\nThe apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle\nspecifically granted to show God's existence. That was\nthe spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several\ncountries. That event is \"approved\" by the Pope. Currently,\nimages of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa\nare showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under\ninvestigation by the Church. But realize that investigations\ntake decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come\nin ten days, that's a bit too late, isn't it 8-).\nOther events under investigation are inner locutions (\"coming\nto know\"), stigmata (the person exhibits Christ's wounds. And\nthey don't heal. And doctor's don't know why).\nNon-believers are welcome to pore through documents, I'm sure.\n\nThis stuff is not like Koresh. Or Oral Roberts (give me $5M\nor God will call me home). It's free. Find out why they're\nhappening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybody\ncan figure this out, tell us ! You can be of any religion.\nIf you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned.\nThese are not \"members only\" events. God and Mary invites \neverybody.\n\nSo in conclusion (finally) ...\nWe RC's believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary.\nWe are scared to death sometimes although we're told not to.\nThere are more proofs and events. And that is why \"not everything\nis in the Bible\". Although in a lot of the apparitions, we are told\nto read the Bible.\n\nAs far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned...\nIn the end, God's churches will unite. I'm not sure how.\nI have some idea. But the point is we shouldn't worry\nabout the \"versus\" part. Just do God's work. That's all\nthat matters. Unity will come.\n\nBTW, I'm just a plain person. I'm not the Pope's spokesperson.\nBut I am RC.\n\n-- ",

Consider the following\nscenario: Runner on third. As the pitcher starts to throw home, the\nrunner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for\nthe suicide squeeze. The pitcher, seeing this, does not throw home,\nbut stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down.

I will\nNOT support the BATF until they clean up their act... Maybe...  As to equipment,\nthe BATF has damn near anything it wants...  Their faults were in intelligence\n(military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??), methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault\na position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting\nnegotiations first), and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms\nand tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have\nvery curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the\nchild-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco\nissues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with\nno violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, then\nthe FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent\nin charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence,\nmurder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend\nthe Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the \npublic what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault\non American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue,\nthe Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated for\nBATF wrongdoing.\n\nJames\n\nbtw, if the BATF came busting in my windows with concussion grenades, you could damn well bet I would return fire to the utmost of my ability.\n\n\n",

There are about 45 CD-ROM disks and a\n4-disk changer hooked to a dedicated MS-DOS computer.  It contains scanned\nimages of data book pages for several thousand parts.  When you ask it for\nsomething it knows about (mostly active IC parts), it works quite well.\nTHey don't handle all the varieties of transistors or diodes that exist.\nIt is definately a start in the right direction, but they need to expand\nthe data base to handle more types of stuff.\n\nThese systems aren't cheap.  We paid about $7,000 for the liscence and get\nmonthly updates of some of the CD-ROM disks.  We send the old ones back to\nthem so that they will keep sending us the updates.  I think we pay a\nyearly maintainence fee of about $1,500 to get the updates.\n\nIf you find the part you want, you can look at the data sheet on a\npage-sized monitor (it's a special monitor from SigmaSystems).  You can\nalso print each page of the datasheet you want on a LaserJet printer.  Page\nprinting takes a couple of minutes per page.  It can take a while to dump\nthe 5 or 6 pages you usually need.\n\nI have a feeling the maker wouldn't like it if we made the data available\nto all Internet users.    :-)\n\n  -dave\n",

    "sequence": "Yes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are \nfinally moving in the right direction.  They should finish\nover .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race \nin August.  However, I would take back a few moves:\n\n1.  The Jim Abbott Trade.\n    I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a\n    great pitcher also.  He could win the Cy Young this year, \n    but he won't because the right side of the Yanks infield\n    isn't good enough.  So why was this not a good trade?  \n    JT Snow.  How many rookies have been able to step in and\n    immediately have the impact that he has had so far on \n    the Angels?  I know it's early, but if you've seen this kid\n    hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be \n    a tremendous player.  The Yanks should have kept him.  What\n    about Mattingly, you ask?  Well - it's great that the Yanks\n    have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he's 10 years\n    older than Snow and just doesn't have the same bat speed as\n    before his back injury.  It's a shame, but as a Yankee fan \n    who wants to see the *best* Yankee team, I'd take \n    Snow over Mattingly at first.  The Yanks also gave up two\n    promising propects with Snow for Abbott.  Besides, with\n    Domingo Jean, Brien taylor, Wickman, Militello, and Sterling\n    Hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects.  I know Abbotts\n    only 26, but this was too much to give up.  I believe George\n    forced this trade because he believes (and he's right) that\n    Abbott will be a big hit in NY.  However, I'd like to see the\n    Yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show.\n\n2.  Wade Boggs.\n    I live in Boston and like Wade a lot.  But, his career is \n    winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop\n    a long term solution (i.e. Hensley Muelins, Russ Davis, Velarde?).\n    Besides, Wade just doesn't have any range.  What a shame about\n    Charlie Hayes, huh?\n\n3.  Spike Owen.\n    See Wade Boggs.  I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri\n    or whoever.  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is\n    going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point.  And these guys\n    are on the down sides of their careers.\n\n4.  Danny Tartabull.\n    Yes - he's put up some tremendous numbers and it's nice to think\n    about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year.  But he\n    never is.  We should expect 120 games max out of him.  Meanwhile,\n    Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O'Neil is playing\n    left field!  I believe O'Neil led NL outfielders in assists\n    last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder.\n\nWhat I'm basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right\ndirection but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year.  They should\n(at the GM level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series.  This\nmeans getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they \nwill be ready in a year or two.  \n\nI'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner.\nCertainly, the Boggs deal was all George.  It looks like George is\nplanning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world\nseries now.  The veterans are always available and can be added at any\ntime (like Boston did this year).  Develop the young players first,\nthen add the one or two veterans (or in the Yankees case, just keep\nthem).  Let's all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn't dismantle\nthe terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee\norganization back into one of respect.  I'm really afraid that he will\ntrade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for\nexample).  George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is\nstill one or two years away.  Have patience George and we will all\nenjoy the future.  Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it's baseball\nhell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time!",

It gives police the power to put\ninnocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they don't\nunderstand.  Most police don't know what the return key does, never mind the\ndifference between a core file and classified military secrets.\n\nThere are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something\nis either.  It could be uninitialized junk.  The burden of proof is on the\nuser to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have.  No\none should ever be put in that situation, especially in America.\n\nWhat's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it, to\nprovide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester\nor drug dealer, or whatever bad thing is in style at the time.  Basically most\npeople don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects.\n\nAs an analogy, it's like they find a loose screw in your house, and they\ninsist that you're building a bomb or machine gun.  They ask you where it came\nfrom (like you'd know), and ask you to prove your claim.  When you explain it\nin such simple terms, people may start to get the idea.\n\nAs a matter of fact, i do keep random files on my disk.  The reason is,\nwithout special-purpose hardware, it takes a long time to generate good random\nbits.  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute, which is\npretty conservative, but over time that's more than i need.\n\nIf you think about it, there's no point in actually encrypting random data,\nbecause it just gives you different random data.  If you want some data to\nlook like an encrypted file, you just put an appropriate header on it.  If\nenough people do this, some of them will be put in jail.\n\nWhen you get arrested and the police ask for your keys, you can tell them it's\njust random junk, although of course they won't believe you.  While you're\nsitting in jail, you can take consolation in the fact that the government will\nburn a few CPU-years trying to find something that's not there.\n",

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their\n   highest court \"Supreme Court,\" \"Supreme Judicial Court\" or \"Supreme\n   Court of Appeals,\" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the\n   \"Court of Appeals.\"  To make matters worse, New York also calls its\n   _second-highest_ court the \"Supreme Court, Appellate Division\"...\n\nAtlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):\n\nOscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\nwhich came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he\ndefendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\nplaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\n\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\nAtlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\n\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\nalways problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\n\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But if\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\nlike eminent domain...)\n\nLet me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that\n\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?\n\n    (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\n    \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\n    extortion statutes.\")\n\nHow do you define as \"blackmail\" one party's act of demanding the right\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\nthey wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\n\nYou go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- the\nplaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"\n\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\nshouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\nAtlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\n\nAnd then you say: \"Everyone's property rights were protected; the\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\"\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\"\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\n(If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\n\n> Is _Boomer_ really being taught as \"infamous?\"  That's really sad if\n> it is, because I fail to see how it's less than completely sensible.\n> You should read the law and economics stuff first-hand instead of\n> filtered through teachers who clearly don't like it, for whatever\n> inexplicable reasons.\n\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my\nschool.\n\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get\ninto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick\nand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional\nResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly\nand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously\nintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly\nbiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors\ntend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\n\nI called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasons\nI've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\nonly call \"economic correctness\" over justice.\n\n(2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\nother people's property by eminent domain.)\n\n> You'd like Posner, Bill.  He's a libertarian.\n\nReally?  I didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to say\nabout cases like _Boomer_?\n\n> Of course, he has too much of a paper trail to ever be nominated by a\n> president, Democrat (won't like his antitrust stance) or Republican\n> (won't like his support of gay marriage), and if bright law students\n> \"shiver\" at what they don't understand, it's easy to imagine how the\n> press will play it up as baby-selling.  (I've seen Mike Godwin claim\n> that Posner asserts that law and economics is applicable to everything\n> and is the end-all and be-all, when Posner says precisely the\n> opposite.)  So it goes.\n\nI've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to\nas \"law and economics\" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical\nanalysis as one of many \"tie-breaker\" factors which courts may use to\nhelp them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by\nthe scale of \"justice\", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by\n_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics\nof a case as being more important than the justice of a case.",

It is easy to say that the one\nbody represents a particular sect of Christianity (generally our own), and\nthe parts are clearly the various offices of ministry. There is a place for\nthat. But having met people who are walking closeely with God in a wide\nvariety of doctine - Catholic, Protestant, liberal, conservative, Orthodox,\netc. - I am willing to encompass a wide spectrum of views within the\ncontext of the 'body of Christ.' And I am equally sure that one day, after\nwe shug off this mortal coil, when we no longer see through a glass darkly\nbut see clearly, face to face, we will all be ashamed at some of the things\nwe held as truth. We ought all fellowship, worship, and serve where we are\ncalled, and understand that where we are called may not be where everyone\nelse is called.\n\nOne of the fathers of the reformation (help me out - can't recall the name)\nput it quite succiently:\n\n\tIn essentials, unity.\n\tIn nonessentials, liberty.\n\tIn all things, charity.\n\nWhile I agree with Lewis (Mere Christianity) that calling oneself a Christian\nimplies some basic, fundamental standards of belief if the word is to mean\nanything at all, I think most of us define the bounds of essentials a bit\ntoo broadly, deny the place for liberty in questionable issues near those\nbounds, and ignore the requirements of charity all together. \n\nMe? I attend a Vineyard church, speak in tongues, am effectively an\ninerrantist, though I'll grant some inaccuracy in translation, am moderately\npre-mill, and evangelical. But, I'm not ready to damn those who use icons,\nsay mass in latin, uphold the Virgin Mary (though I really don't believe\nthat she was sinless), vote on Church membership, or insist on baptism for\nsalvation. Of course, I think my doctine is pretty close to the truth -\nwhy would I follow it if I believed something else was closer to the truth?\nBut my understanding of the reality of a walk with Christ is continually\nevolving as I spend more and more time walking with Him, studying His word,\nand fellowshiping with others in the (often extended) family. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.                    \n  --T.S.

If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it\nalmost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse\nIMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.\n\nI think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be\nexpanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored\ndata. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such\nexpansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident).\nThere was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please\nbear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say\nwhat others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.\n\n>Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The\n>telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule\n>today.\n\nAs I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or\nsimilar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions\nsuch as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how\nthis thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat\nthis in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other\nareas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if\nthis proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in\nseveral other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not\ngoing to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop\nwhenever they want to.  'Court order required' has proven to be a rather\nflimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the\nmaterial, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on\nperiodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice\nsystem the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty\n(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not\nprotected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would\nresult in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions\non private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it\ndoes make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially\nfishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.  Don't give up the\nright to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton\nand Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,\nfiguring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come\nthose consulted could be roughly described as \"us insiders\"?  They cannot\nquietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its\nexclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.\nDon't buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,\npast or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest\nand the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not 'unlikely'\nor 'difficult'.\n\n>But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the\n>judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext\n>without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain\n>cellular calls and then ask a judge, \"Hey, can we have permission to\n>listen to those tapes?\" can they?\n\nSo what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved\nafter the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,\neasily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,\nwould authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  This\nhas been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For\nlocal cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds\nhave a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe\nfor example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen\nin on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or\nvia a 'master key'?  I sure don't.\n\nThis whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use\nold-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping\nwas rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law\nEnforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes\nthat require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I\njust find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much\nabout civil and individual rights, that \"puts people first\".  The question\nis \"put people first\" to WHERE?\n\nWith the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN'T\nexist a 'master key' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword\nscan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific\ncourt order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.\nBet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that\nthey have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to\nkeep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? After\nawhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks\nthey deem 'disruptive'.  And if they get only one key, that would\nreduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember\nNixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn't it?\n\nAnd unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!\nI see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice\n:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to\na competitor's Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded\nto be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get\none the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important\nconcern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...\n\n>>worse, of course, if the government then uses this \"Clinton Clipper\"\n>>to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption. (This is the main\n>>concern of most of us, I think. The camel's nose in the tent, etc.)\n>\n>Yes, that is a major concern, but I think that they think they can\n>win just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system.  They don't even\n>have to care about the cautious .5% that's left.  They don't catch the\n>really smart crooks anyway.

That's why he's in jail now.\n>Hard to believe, but true.\n\nWhat will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You\ncan BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.\nIt is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the\nargumet \"well, if you got nothing to hide...\"  Fine. Then using that\nargument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in\nevery room of one's home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but\nthe principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a\ngovt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as\nto 'safeguards'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are\npretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.\n\nDon't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish\nbad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.\n\n>This scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more, which people would\n>fight a lot harder.  They like this enough that they are dropping the so\n>called \"Digital Telephony\" proposal, according to rumours.  However the\n>meaning of that is complex, since they still want to get at the crypttext\n>on telco systems, and that requires a bit of work.\n\nPeople would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years,\nbecause we have this 'crisis' situation which MUST be addressed by some\n'drastic action', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother\nthose who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don't buy into it.\n\nIf the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public\nso many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few\nisolated 'respected experts' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a\ncertain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected\nexperts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was\nadvocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the\nexperts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper\nChip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled\nversion (with a 'master key' provision), or features not present in the\nversion subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who\nchooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there...\n:-)\n\nAnd isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT\nhave its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?\nI was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything\nyou have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this\ngroup are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...\n\nAnother question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not\nbe used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure\nbut \"good enough\" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full\ndescription (not a PR non-statement) of just what \"good enough\" means?\nI think when saying how strong it is, \"good enough\" really means \"not\nvery\".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not\nacceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and\nConstitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other\ncountries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as\nrevokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and\nprotections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA\nhave this thing to 'fight crime'.  We have allready have our Bill of\nRights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining\nfor yet another 'noble cause', instead we should be trying to repair\nthe damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \"too\nmany rights and safeguards\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court\nsystem and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having\n\"too many rights\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,\netc).\n\nBTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe\nthis:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed\nthis thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights\nunder the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades\nhave been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the\nConstitution.  It has to stop.  Now is as good a time as any, if it\nisn't too late allready.\n\n>-- \n>Brad Templeton, ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale, CA 408/296-0366\n\n",

    "sequence": "Here is a press release from the White House.\n\n Text of President Clinton's Letter to Congress on Iranian Assets\n To: National Desk\n Contact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2100\n\n   WASHINGTON, May 14  -- Following is a letter\nPresident Clinton wrote to Congress on Iranian Assets:\n\n  TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:\n\n       I hereby report to the Congress on developments since the\n  last Presidential report on November 10, 1992, concerning the\n  national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in\n  Executive Order No. 12170 of November 14, 1979, and matters\n  relating to Executive Order No. 12613 of October 29, 1987.\n  This report is submitted pursuant to section 204(c) of the\n  International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c),\n  and section 505(c) of the International Security and Development\n  Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9(c).  This report\n  covers events through March 31, 1993.  The last report, dated\n  November 10, 1992, covered events through October 15, 1992.\n\n       1.  There have been no amendments to the Iranian\n  Transactions Regulations (\"ITRs\"), 31 CFR Part 560, or to the\n  Iranian Assets Control Regulations (\"IACRs\"), 31 CFR Part 535,\n  since the last report.\n\n       2.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"FAC\") of the\n  Department of the Treasury continues to process applications\n  for import licenses under the ITRs.  However, as previously\n  reported, recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a\n  substantial decrease in the number of applications received\n  relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranian-origin goods.\n\n       During the reporting period, the Customs Service has\n  continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin\n  merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import\n  prohibitions of the ITRs.  FAC and Customs Service investi-\n  gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions\n  and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.  Additional\n  forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review.\n\n       3.  The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the\n  \"Tribunal\"), established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers\n  Accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims\n  before it.  Since the last report, the Tribunal has rendered\n  12 awards, for a total of 545 awards.  Of that total, 367 have\n  been awards in favor of American claimants:  222 of these were\n  awards on agreed terms, authorizing and approving payment of\n  settlements negotiated by the parties, and 145 were decisions\n  adjudicated on the merits.  The Tribunal has issued 36 decisions\n  dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing\n  claims for jurisdictional reasons.  Of the 59 remaining awards,\n  3 approved the withdrawal of cases, and 56 were in favor of\n  Iranian claimants.  As of March 31, 1993, awards to successful\n  American claimants from the Security Account held by the\n  NV Settlement Bank stood at $2,340,072,357.77.\n\n       As of March 31, 1993, the Security Account has fallen\n  below the required balance of $500 million 36 times.  Iran has\n  periodically replenished the account, as required by the Algiers\n  Accords, by transferring funds from the separate account held by\n  the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account\n  is deposited.  Iran has also replenished the account with the\n  proceeds from the sale of Iranian-origin oil imported into the\n  United States, pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by-\n  case basis by FAC.  Iran has not, however, replenished the\n  account since the last oil sale deposit on October 8, 1992.\n  The aggregate amount that has been transferred from the Interest\n  Account to the Security Account is $874,472,986.47.  As of\n  March 31, 1993, the total amount in the Security Account was\n  $216,244,986.03, and the total amount in the Interest Account\n  was $8,638,133.15.\n\n       4.  The Tribunal continues to make progress in the\n  arbitration of claims of U.S. nationals for $250,000.00 or more.\n  Since the last report, nine large claims have been decided.\n  More than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been\n  disposed of through adjudication, settlement, or voluntary\n  withdrawal, leaving 76 such claims on the docket.  The larger\n  claims, the resolution of which has been slowed by their\n  complexity, are finally being resolved, sometimes with sizable\n  awards to the U.S. claimants.  For example, two claimants were\n  awarded more than $130 million each by the Tribunal in October\n  1992.\n\n       5.  As anticipated by the May 13, 1990, agreement settling\n  the claims of U.S. nationals for less than $250,000.00, the\n  Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (\"FCSC\") has continued its\n  review of 3,112 claims.  The FCSC has issued decisions in\n  1,201 claims, for total awards of more than $22 million.  The\n  FCSC expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining\n  claims in early 1994.\n\n       6.  In coordination with concerned Government agencies,\n  the Department of State continues to present United States\n  Government claims against Iran, as well as responses by the\n  United States Government to claims brought against it by Iran.\n  In November 1992, the United States filed 25 volumes of\n  supporting information in case B/1 (Claims 2 & 3), Iran's claim\n  against the United States for damages relating to its Foreign\n  Military Sales Program.  In February of this year, the United\n  States participated in a daylong prehearing conference in\n several other cases involving military equipment.  Iran also\n  filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure\n  of U.S. courts to enforce an award against a U.S. corporation\n  violated the Algiers Accords.\n\n       7.  As reported in November, Jose Maria Ruda, President of\n  the Tribunal, tendered his resignation on October 2, 1992.  No\n  successor has yet been named.  Judge Ruda's resignation will\n  take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up\n  his duties.\n\n       8.  The situation reviewed above continues to involve\n  important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the\n  United States and its nationals.  Iran's policy behavior\n  presents challenges to the national security and foreign\n  policy of the United States.  The IACRs issued pursuant to\n  Executive Order No. 12170 continue to play an important role\n  in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling\n  the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords.\n  Similarly, the ITRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12613\n  continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter-\n  national terrorism.  I shall exercise the powers at my disposal\n  to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the\n  Congress on significant developments.\n\n\n                         WILLIAM J. CLINTON\n\n\n  THE WHITE HOUSE,\n      May 14, 1993.\n\n -30-\n\n\n",
